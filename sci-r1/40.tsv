Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
The provided text does not contain any explicit data for the required columns (Ligand name, Receptor protein name, Receptor protein organism source, Affinity value, Wet lab method, or PDBID). The text includes a citation, author list, and journal information but lacks specific experimental details such as affinity values, measurement methods, or structural PDB identifiers. Therefore, no valid TSV entries can be generated from this excerpt.
