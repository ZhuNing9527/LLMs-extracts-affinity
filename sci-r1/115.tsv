This TSV file contains four entries extracted directly from the kinetic data in Table 2 of the paper, showing interactions between HprK/P and its protein substrates HPr/Crh under different nucleotide conditions (with/without AMPPNP). All interactions were measured using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) methodology. No PDB IDs were mentioned in the text for these complexes.
