**Note:** The provided text does not explicitly report affinity values (Kd, Ki, IC50) or experimental methods for affinity measurement (e.g., SPR, ITC). The PDB IDs (3EO9, 3EOA, 3EOB) are explicitly mentioned in the text as structures deposited for the Efalizumab Fab alone and in complex with the LFA-1 I domain. The affinity and method columns are left blank as no direct data was found in the text.
