# Extracted Data Explanation:
- **Ligand name**: "COMPOUND 5" is explicitly named as the ligand in the text (Table II, Results section).
- **Receptor protein name**: "HIF-1a" is the receptor protein described in the study (Abstract, Results).
- **Receptor protein organism source**: "Homo sapiens" is stated in the structural deposition note (PDB ID 4H6J).
- **Affinity value**: "Kd=10 ?M" is directly reported for the COMPOUND 5 conjugate in Table III (SPR analysis).
- **Wet lab method**: "surface plasmon resonance (SPR)" is the method used for affinity measurement (Table III caption, Results section).
- **PDBID**: "4H6J" is explicitly provided as the PDB ID for the HIF-1a/ARNT complex (Structure deposition paragraph). 

No additional entries were found, as other affinity values (e.g., ITC data in Table I) pertain to unmodified proteins or non-ligand interactions.
