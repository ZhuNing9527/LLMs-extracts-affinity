``` 

**Notes:**  
1. **Organism Source:** The receptor proteins (UCH-L3 and Isopeptidase T) were purified from rabbit reticulocytes (*Oryctolagus cuniculus*).  
2. **Affinity Values:**  
   - For **UCH-L3 + Ub-AMC**, \( K_m = 38.6 \, \text{nM} \) (directly extracted from Table 1).  
   - For **Isopeptidase T + Ub-AMC**, two \( K_m \) values are reported depending on Ub presence: \( 1.4 \, \mu\text{M} \) (0 ?M Ub) and \( 0.17 \, \mu\text{M} \) (0.5 ?M Ub) (Table 1).  
   - For **UCH-L3 + Ub-H**, \( K_i < 50 \, \text{fM} \) (from the inhibition study in Figure 5).  
3. **Wet Lab Method:** All measurements used fluorescence-based enzyme activity assays (described in the "Kinetic Methods" section).  
4. **PDBID:** No PDB IDs were mentioned in the text.
