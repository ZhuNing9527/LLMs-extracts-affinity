2. TusA	IscS	Escherichia coli	Kd=0.966 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	
3. IscS	TusA	Escherichia coli	Kd=0.304 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	
4. IscU	IscS	Escherichia coli	Kd=14.6 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	
5. IscS	IscU	Escherichia coli	Kd=0.574 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	

**Explanation:**
- **Ligand and Receptor:** The ligand is the analyte in solution, and the receptor is the immobilized protein in the SPR experiments.
- **Affinity Values:** Extracted KD values from Table 7 in the text.
- **Organism Source:** All proteins are from *Escherichia coli* as the study focuses on E. coli.
- **Wet Lab Method:** Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is explicitly mentioned as the method used.
- **PDBID:** No PDB IDs were provided in the text, so this column is left blank.
