Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Since the provided text does not explicitly mention any of the required fields (ligand name, receptor protein name, receptor protein organism source, affinity value with units, wet lab method, or PDBID), no data can be extracted. The text primarily discusses polyketide intermediates, assays (BIA, MBL), and references to unpublished data or GenBank accession numbers, but none of these meet the specific extraction criteria outlined. Adhering strictly to the instruction to avoid inference or data tampering, no TSV entries can be generated.
