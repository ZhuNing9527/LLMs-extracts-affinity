Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Since the provided cleaned text does not contain explicit data on affinity values, wet lab methods, PDBIDs, or organism sources for the ligand-receptor pairs mentioned (APRIL/BLyS and TACI), no entries can be extracted according to the instructions. Below is the formatted response adhering to the requirements:
