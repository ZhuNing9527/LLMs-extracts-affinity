Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll help you extract the data from the scientific literature text. Based on the requirements, I'll create a TSV output with the extracted information.

Here's the extracted data in TSV format:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
all-trans retinol	Retinol-binding protein (RBP)	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.2 ?M	fluorescence anisotropy	N/A
all-trans retinol	Transthyretin (TTR)	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.2 ?M	fluorescence anisotropy	N/A
apoRBP	Transthyretin (TTR)	Homo sapiens	Kd=1.2 ?M	fluorescence anisotropy	N/A
all-trans retinoic acid	Retinol-binding protein (RBP)	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.8 ?M	fluorescence anisotropy	N/A
all-trans retinyl methyl ether	Retinol-binding protein (RBP)	Homo sapiens	Kd=6 ?M	fluorescence anisotropy	N/A
fenretinide	Retinol-binding protein (RBP)	Homo sapiens	Kd=Negligible	fluorescence anisotropy	N/A
```

Notes:
- I extracted the data directly from the text as requested
- The "Corresponding complex PDBID" is marked as N/A since no specific PDB ID was mentioned in the text
- The wet lab method is consistently "fluorescence anisotropy" as described in the paper
- Affinity values are reported as found in the text, with the original units preserved
