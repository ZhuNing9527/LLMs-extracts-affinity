Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I apologize, but after carefully reviewing the provided text, I cannot extract the requested data in the specified TSV format. The text appears to be a partial bibliographic reference for a scientific publication about Pseudomonas aeruginosa Exotoxin A, but it does not contain the specific details required for the 6 columns:

1. Ligand name
2. Receptor protein name
3. Receptor protein organism source
4. Affinity value
5. Wet lab method for affinity measurement
6. Corresponding complex PDBID

The text is primarily a journal citation and does not provide the detailed experimental data needed to populate the TSV format. To extract the requested information, I would need the full text of the scientific literature, not just the bibliographic reference.

If you have the complete text of the scientific paper, please provide it, and I'll be happy to help you extract the specific data points you're looking for.
