Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, here's the TSV output:

```
von Willebrand Factor Domain A1	Platelet Glycoprotein Iba	Homo sapiens	Kd=3.3 mM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
von Willebrand Factor Domain A1(R545A)	Platelet Glycoprotein Iba	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.16 mM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
von Willebrand Factor Domain A1	Platelet Glycoprotein Iba(G233V)	Homo sapiens	Kd=1.0 mM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
von Willebrand Factor Domain A1	Platelet Glycoprotein Iba(M239V)	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.63 mM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
von Willebrand Factor Domain A1	Platelet Glycoprotein Iba(G233V/M239V)	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.59 mM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
```

Notes:
- The wet lab method is inferred from the detailed kinetic measurements described in the text
- No PDB ID was provided in the text, so "N/A" is used
- The affinity values are reported as Kd (dissociation constant)
- All measurements are from the same organism (Homo sapiens)
- The ligand is the von Willebrand Factor Domain A1, with various mutations noted
- The receptor is Platelet Glycoprotein Iba, also with various mutations
