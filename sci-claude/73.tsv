Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, I notice that this text is a detailed scientific paper about T cell receptor interactions with superantigens, and does not contain direct measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity in the typical format requested.

I'll provide the most relevant data I can extract, though it may not perfectly match all the requested columns:

```
Staphylococcal Enterotoxin C3 (SEC3)	T Cell Receptor (TCR)	Mus musculus	Not directly specified	Not directly specified	Not available
```

Key observations:
- The paper discusses interactions between Staphylococcal Enterotoxin C3 (SEC3) and T Cell Receptors
- The organism source is mouse (Mus musculus)
- The paper does not provide a direct affinity measurement in the Kd/Ki/IC50 format
- No specific PDB ID is mentioned for the complex

The text is more focused on the structural and kinetic interactions between superantigens (like SEC3) and T cell receptors, rather than providing a direct affinity measurement. A more specialized affinity measurement paper would be needed to fully populate the requested TSV columns.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the extraction or explain why a complete TSV cannot be generated from this text?
