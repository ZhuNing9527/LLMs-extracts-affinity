Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
CD2	CD58	Homo sapiens	Kd=9-22 pM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
```

Key observations:
- The study used surface plasmon resonance to measure the binding affinity between human CD2 and human CD58
- The affinity was determined to be very low, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 9-22 pM
- The organism source for both proteins is Homo sapiens
- No PDB complex ID was provided in the text

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
1. Ligand name is "CD2"
2. Receptor protein name is "CD58"
3. Organism source is "Homo sapiens"
4. Affinity value is "Kd=9-22 pM"
5. Wet lab method is "surface plasmon resonance"
6. Corresponding complex PDBID is left blank (N/A)
