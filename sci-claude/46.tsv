Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text provided, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, after carefully reviewing the text, I cannot find any specific ligand-receptor binding affinity measurements that match the exact requirements. The text is a structural biology paper about actin capping protein (CP) and its interactions with V-1 and CARMIL proteins, but it does not provide direct ligand-receptor binding affinity data in the requested format.

Here's an empty TSV output to reflect this:

```

If you would like me to extract other types of data from this text, such as protein interaction details or structural information, I can do so. Would you like me to provide those details instead?
