Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text provided, I'll extract the data according to the specified requirements. However, in this particular text, there are no direct measurements of ligand-receptor interactions that fully match the requested output format. The text is a scientific paper about Ran protein interactions, discussing protein-protein interactions related to nuclear transport, but not providing specific affinity measurements in the requested format.

Here's an empty TSV output to reflect the lack of extractable data:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
```

Key observations:
- The text discusses Ran protein interactions with importin-¦Â, RanBP1, and RanBP2
- It mentions some interaction characteristics (e.g., "Importin-¦Â binds Ran?GTP with a moderate rate, but attains a high affinity for Ran (KD = 140 pM)")
- Methods used include surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence-labeled probes
- The organism sources include human cellular components

However, these details do not fully meet the strict extraction requirements specified in the instructions. To properly extract data, I would need a text with more explicit affinity measurement details for specific ligand-receptor pairs.
