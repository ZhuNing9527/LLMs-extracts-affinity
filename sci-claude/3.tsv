Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll help extract the data from the scientific literature text. However, I noticed that the text provided does not contain any direct measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity that match the specified output format. The text is primarily about antibody responses to vaccinia virus extracellular virion (EV) surface proteins.

Since no affinity measurements are present, I'll provide an empty TSV output:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
```

If you would like me to extract a different type of data from this text, or if you have a different text with affinity measurements, please provide more details or the specific text.
