Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, here's the TSV output:

```
Protective Antigen	CMG2 VWA domain	Homo sapiens	Kd=170 pM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
```

Explanation of the extraction:
1. Ligand name: Protective Antigen (PA)
2. Receptor protein name: CMG2 VWA domain
3. Receptor protein organism source: Homo sapiens (from the context of the paper discussing human anthrax toxin receptor)
4. Affinity value: Kd=170 pM (as reported in the text for Mg2-liganded complex)
5. Wet lab method for affinity measurement: surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: Not available (N/A) in the text

Note: The paper does not provide a specific PDB ID for the complex, so I've used N/A for that column.
