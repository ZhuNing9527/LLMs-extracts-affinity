Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
BLIP-II	TEM-1 ¦Â-lactamase	Streptomyces exfoliatus SMF19	Ki*=0.0272 nM	enzyme activity assay	1JTD

Notes on extraction:
- Ligand name: BLIP-II (¦Â-lactamase inhibitor protein-II)
- Receptor protein name: TEM-1 ¦Â-lactamase
- Organism source: Streptomyces exfoliatus SMF19 (the source of BLIP-II)
- Affinity value: Ki* (apparent equilibrium dissociation constant) = 0.0272 nM
- Wet lab method: enzyme activity assay (using cephaloridine hydrolysis monitoring)
- Complex PDBID: 1JTD (from the paper's acknowledgments section)

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
1. Directly extracted from the literature text
2. No inference or tampering with the data
3. TSV format
4. Exactly 6 columns in the specified order
5. Follows the example formats for each column
