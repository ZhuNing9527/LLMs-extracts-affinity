Notes:
1. The organism source is listed as Homo sapiens, though the original text mentions turkey ovomucoid (OMTKY3).
2. The affinity values are reported as association equilibrium constants (K?¡ãbs).
3. No PDB IDs were provided in the text.
4. The wet lab method is described as "enzyme-inhibitor equilibrium constants measurement".

The data represents the binding affinities of semisynthetic ovomucoid third domain peptides with various serine proteinases.
