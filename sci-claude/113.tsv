Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll help you extract the data from the scientific literature text. Based on the requirements, I'll create a TSV output with the specified columns.

In this case, the text describes a study about an antibody (AL-57) targeting the LFA-1 integrin. I'll extract the relevant information:

```tsv
AL-57	LFA-1	Homo sapiens	Kd=23 nM	surface plasmon resonance	None reported
```

Let me break down the extraction:

1. Ligand name: AL-57 (a monoclonal antibody)
2. Receptor protein name: LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1)
3. Receptor protein organism source: Homo sapiens (human)
4. Affinity value: Kd=23 nM (from Table 3 in the text, for the high-affinity I domain)
5. Wet lab method for affinity measurement: surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: None reported in the text

The affinity value is specifically for the high-affinity (HA) state of the LFA-1 I domain, as measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in the study.
