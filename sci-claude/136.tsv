Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll help you extract the data from the scientific literature text. Based on the requirements, I'll create a TSV output with the specified columns. However, after carefully reviewing the text, I did not find a complete set of measurements that match all the required columns. 

Here's the most relevant data I could extract:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)	gp130	Not specified	Kd = 80 nM	Isothermal titration calorimetry	Not provided
```

A few important notes:
1. The text provides details about the LIF-gp130 interaction, but does not specify the organism source for gp130.
2. The affinity value is derived from the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements mentioned in the text.
3. No specific PDB ID for the complex was mentioned.

Would you like me to elaborate on the data extraction process or provide more context from the text?
