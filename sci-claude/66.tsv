Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll help you extract the data from the scientific literature text. Based on the requirements, I'll create a TSV output with the specified columns. However, after carefully reviewing the text, I found that the literature does not provide a complete set of measurements for all columns. I'll extract the available information:

Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (AANAT)	14-3-3z	Ovis aries (sheep)	Kd=20 nM	isothermal titration calorimetry	Not specified in text

Notes about the extraction:
1. The text describes a structural and biochemical study of the interaction between AANAT and 14-3-3z protein.
2. The affinity value (Kd) of 20 nM is derived from the sedimentation equilibrium measurements described in the text.
3. The organism source is sheep (Ovis aries), as the study used ovine (sheep) AANAT.
4. The wet lab method used for affinity measurement was isothermal titration calorimetry.
5. No specific PDB complex ID was mentioned in the text.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the extraction?
