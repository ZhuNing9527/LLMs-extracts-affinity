Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there is only one clear set of binding data:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Tendamistat	Porcine pancreatic ¦Á-amylase	Sus scrofa	Kd=9.2 ¡Á 10^-12 M	surface plasmon resonance	1BVN
```

A few notes on the extraction:
- The organism source is "Sus scrofa" (domestic pig) for porcine pancreatic ¦Á-amylase
- The affinity value is derived from the SPR measurements reported in the text (Table 1)
- The complex PDBID is referenced in the text as 1BVN
- The wet lab method is surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which was the primary method used to measure binding kinetics

The text describes experiments with three variants of tendamistat (wild-type and two permuted variants), but the primary binding characterization is for the wild-type tendamistat binding to porcine pancreatic ¦Á-amylase.
