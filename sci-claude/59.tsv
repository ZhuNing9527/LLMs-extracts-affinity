Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Alkaline Proteinase Inhibitor (APRin)	Alkaline Proteinase (APR)	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	Kd=4 pM	analytical ultracentrifugation	N/A
```

Key observations:
- The text describes the interaction between the Alkaline Proteinase Inhibitor (APRin) and Alkaline Proteinase (APR) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa
- The affinity was measured as an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of approximately 4 pM at 25?°„C, pH 7.0
- The primary method for characterizing the interaction was analytical ultracentrifugation
- No specific PDB ID was mentioned for the complex

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
1. Ligand name is the inhibitor protein
2. Receptor protein name is the proteinase 
3. Organism source is Pseudomonas aeruginosa
4. Affinity value is in the requested Kd format
5. Wet lab method is analytical ultracentrifugation
6. Complex PDBID is marked as N/A since none was provided
