Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Fab HyHEL-63	Hen egg white lysozyme (HEL)	Gallus gallus	KA=3.5 ¡Á 10^8 M^-1	surface plasmon resonance	1dqj
```

Key observations:
- The text describes a detailed structural study of the Fab HyHEL-63 antibody binding to hen egg white lysozyme (HEL)
- The affinity was measured using surface plasmon resonance
- The complex structure was deposited in the Protein Data Bank with ID 1dqj
- The organism source is Gallus gallus (chicken), as hen egg white lysozyme comes from chicken eggs

The affinity is reported as an association constant (KA) of 3.5 ¡Á 10^8 M^-1, which corresponds to the standard format requested in the output requirements.
