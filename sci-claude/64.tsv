Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text and format it as a TSV with the specified columns. Based on the text, I found one relevant data point:

```tsv
E2	Membrane-type serine protease 1 (MT-SP1)	Homo sapiens	KI=8.0 pM	surface plasmon resonance	Not specified
```

Key observations:
- The text describes two antibody inhibitors (E2 and S4) of the membrane-type serine protease 1 (MT-SP1)
- The organism source is Homo sapiens
- The affinity is measured as KI (inhibition constant)
- The method of affinity measurement is surface plasmon resonance
- No corresponding PDB complex ID was mentioned in the text

The data point represents the most precise affinity measurement for the E2 antibody inhibitor against MT-SP1 from the provided scientific literature.
