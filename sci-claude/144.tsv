Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there are no direct measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity that match the exact requirements. The paper focuses on interactions between Rac GTPases and Phospholipase C-¦Â (PLC-¦Â) isozymes, particularly PLC-¦Â2.

Here's the closest match I can provide in the requested format:

```
Rac1	Phospholipase C-¦Â2	Homo sapiens	Kd=5.3 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	None
Rac2	Phospholipase C-¦Â2	Homo sapiens	Kd=7.0 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	None
Rac3	Phospholipase C-¦Â2	Homo sapiens	Kd=9.3 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	None
```

Notes:
- The paper reports dissociation constants (Kd) for interactions between Rac GTPases and PLC-¦Â2
- No specific peptide ligand is identified
- No PDB complex ID is provided
- The organism source is Homo sapiens (human)
- The wet lab method is surface plasmon resonance

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this extraction?
