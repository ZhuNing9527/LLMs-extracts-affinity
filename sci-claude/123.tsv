Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text provided, I'll extract the data according to the specified requirements. However, I notice that this text is a detailed structural biology paper about the CDK2-CksHs1 protein complex, and does not contain direct ligand-receptor affinity measurements. 

Here's the output in TSV format:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
CksHs1	CDK2	Homo sapiens	Kd=7.7 ¡Á 10^-8 M	surface plasmon resonance	Not specified
```

Key notes:
1. The affinity value is extracted from the text: "The Kd for wild-type CksHs1 was 7.7 ¡Á 10^-8 M"
2. The wet lab method is surface plasmon resonance, as mentioned in the "Binding Affinity Measurements" section
3. No specific PDB ID is mentioned for this complex
4. The organism source is Homo sapiens
5. The ligand is CksHs1 and the receptor is CDK2

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the extraction?
