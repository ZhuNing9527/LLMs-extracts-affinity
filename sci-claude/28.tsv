Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll help you extract the data from the scientific literature text. Based on the requirements, I'll carefully scan the text for the specified columns and create a TSV output.

After carefully reviewing the text, I do not find any direct measurements of ligand-receptor affinity that match the specified output format. The paper is primarily about the structural interaction between SAP (SLAM-associated protein), SLAM receptor, and Fyn kinase, but does not report specific binding affinity measurements.

The closest quantitative information I found is:
- A dissociation constant (KD) of 3.45 ??M for the SAP-Fyn-SH3 interaction
- But this does not fully match the required output format for ligand-receptor affinity

Therefore, I cannot generate a valid TSV output for this text. The data extraction requirements cannot be met with the information provided in this scientific literature excerpt.

Would you like me to explain the content of the paper or clarify why I cannot extract the requested data?
