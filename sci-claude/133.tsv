Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I apologize, but after carefully reviewing the provided text, I cannot extract the specific data points requested in the TSV format. The text appears to be a fragment of a scientific publication metadata or reference section, and does not contain clear information about:

- Ligand names
- Receptor protein names
- Receptor protein organism sources
- Affinity values
- Wet lab methods for affinity measurement
- Complex PDB IDs

The text seems to be a bibliographic reference for a paper about APRIL and BLyS receptors, but lacks the detailed experimental data required to populate the 6 columns you specified.

To successfully extract the requested information, I would need the full text of the scientific literature, particularly the methods, results, or discussion sections that typically contain experimental details about protein-ligand interactions.

If you have the full text of the scientific literature, please provide it, and I'll be happy to help you extract the specific data points in the requested TSV format.
