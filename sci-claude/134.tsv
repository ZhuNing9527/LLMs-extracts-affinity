Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following extraction:

```
Sonic hedgehog	Patched1	Homo sapiens	Kd=1.1 nM	biolayer interferometry	3MXV
Sonic hedgehog	Patched1	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.31 nM	biolayer interferometry	3MXV
Sonic hedgehog	Patched1	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.7 nM	isothermal titration calorimetry	3MXV
```

Explanation of the extraction:
1. The text describes the binding of the 5E1 antibody to Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and its interaction with the Patched1 receptor.
2. The organism source is Homo sapiens.
3. Affinity values are extracted from different measurement techniques:
   - Biolayer interferometry shows Kd values of 1.1 nM and 0.31 nM
   - Isothermal titration calorimetry shows a Kd of 0.7 nM
4. The corresponding complex PDBID is 3MXV
5. The wet lab methods are biolayer interferometry and isothermal titration calorimetry

The data is presented in TSV format with the 6 specified columns.
