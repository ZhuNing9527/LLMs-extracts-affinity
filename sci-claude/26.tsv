Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following data for extraction:

```tsv
Cytochrome c	Cytochrome c Peroxidase	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Kd=Not specified	isothermal titration calorimetry	Not specified
```

Notes on the extraction:
1. Ligand name: "Cytochrome c" (horse heart cytochrome c)
2. Receptor protein name: "Cytochrome c Peroxidase"
3. Receptor protein organism source: "Saccharomyces cerevisiae" (baker's yeast)
4. Affinity value: The text does not provide a direct Kd value, but mentions an equilibrium association constant (KA) of 10 ¡À 4 ¡Á 10^4 M^-1
5. Wet lab method: "isothermal titration calorimetry"
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: Not specified in the text

The extraction follows the specified TSV format with exactly 6 columns. The data is extracted directly from the literature without inference or tampering.
