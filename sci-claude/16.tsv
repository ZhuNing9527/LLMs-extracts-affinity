Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following data for extraction:

Ligand name: RH24 (recombinant HIV-1 capsid protein)
Receptor protein name: Fab13B5 (monoclonal antibody fragment)
Receptor protein organism source: Mus musculus (mouse)
Affinity value: Kd=29 nM
Wet lab method for affinity measurement: surface plasmon resonance
Corresponding complex PDBID: Not explicitly stated in the text

Here's the output in TSV format:

```
RH24	Fab13B5	Mus musculus	Kd=29 nM	surface plasmon resonance	
```

Notes:
- The affinity was measured using surface plasmon resonance
- The antibody is a mouse monoclonal antibody (Mus musculus)
- The ligand is a recombinant HIV-1 capsid protein (RH24)
- No specific PDB ID was provided for the complex in the text
- The data is extracted directly from the literature without inference
