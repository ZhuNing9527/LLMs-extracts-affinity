Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data according to the specified requirements. In this case, there's only one affinity measurement to extract:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Hen egg white lysozyme (HEL)	Anti-HEL antibody D1.3 Fv fragment	Not specified	Not directly specified	Isothermal titration calorimetry	Not provided in text
```

Notes:
- The text describes a detailed structural and thermodynamic study of an antigen-antibody interaction between hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) and an anti-HEL antibody (D1.3 Fv fragment).
- While the paper extensively discusses the binding interaction, it does not explicitly state a precise affinity value (Kd, Ki, or IC50).
- The organism source is not explicitly stated in the text.
- The wet lab method for affinity measurement is isothermal titration calorimetry, which is mentioned in the "Titration Calorimetry" section.
- No PDB ID is directly mentioned in the extracted text, though the authors note they deposited coordinates in the Protein Data Bank.

I've followed the instructions to extract data directly from the text without inference or tampering, resulting in a somewhat incomplete TSV entry due to the limitations of the source text.
