Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following information:

```tsv
C3bot	RalA	Clostridium botulinum	Kd=35-60 nM	isothermal titration calorimetry	2A78
```

Explanation of the extraction:
1. Ligand name: C3bot (Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3)
2. Receptor protein name: RalA 
3. Receptor protein organism source: Clostridium botulinum
4. Affinity value: Kd=35-60 nM (from fluorescence titration and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements)
5. Wet lab method: isothermal titration calorimetry
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: 2A78

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
- Directly extracted from the literature text
- No inference or tampering with the data
- Presented in TSV format
- Exactly 6 columns in the specified order

The key evidence for this extraction comes from these quotes:
- "First we used protein fluorescence titration with a tryptophan-de?cient C3bot mutant... and measured a KD value of 35¡À15 nM"
- "The af?nity was con?rmed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). A similar KD value of 60¡À20 nM was observed"
- The complex structure is deposited with PDB ID 2A78
