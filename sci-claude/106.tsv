Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
CK2b1-193	CK2a1-335	Homo sapiens	Kd=12.6 nM	isothermal titration calorimetry	N/A
```

Notes on extraction:
- Ligand name: CK2b1-193 (the CK2b subunit)
- Receptor protein name: CK2a1-335 (the CK2a catalytic subunit)
- Organism source: Homo sapiens (human)
- Affinity value: Directly quoted from the text as Kd=12.6 nM
- Wet lab method: Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
- Complex PDBID: Not provided in the text (marked as N/A)

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
1. Directly extracted from the literature text
2. No inference or tampering with the data
3. TSV format with 6 columns
4. Each line represents one wet test measurement of affinity
