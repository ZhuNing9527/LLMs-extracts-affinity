Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, after carefully reviewing the text, I found that this specific paper does not contain a complete set of measurements for all 6 requested columns. I'll extract the available information:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
VHHmetal	RNase A	Not specified	Kd=155 ?M (for RNase A)	Isothermal titration calorimetry	4POU
VHHmetal	Ni2+	Not specified	Kd=30 ?M (for Ni2+)	Isothermal titration calorimetry	4PPT
```

Notes:
1. The organism source is not explicitly stated in the text.
2. The affinity values are derived from the text's description of the VHHmetal variant.
3. The wet lab method is isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) as mentioned in the Materials and Methods section.
4. The corresponding PDB IDs are provided in the text.

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
- TSV format
- 6 columns in the specified order
- Data extracted directly from the literature without inference
- Affinity values follow the specified format (Kd=X ?M)
