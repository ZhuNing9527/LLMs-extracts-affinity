Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text provided, I do not see any specific ligand-receptor interactions that would directly map to the requested TSV output format. The text appears to be a detailed scientific article about the structural biology of GGA proteins and their interactions with ARF proteins, focusing on protein trafficking mechanisms.

The text does not contain clear, extractable data points for:
1. Ligand name
2. Receptor protein name
3. Receptor protein organism source
4. Affinity value
5. Wet lab method for affinity measurement
6. Corresponding complex PDBID

While the article discusses protein interactions (like GGA and ARF), it does not provide the specific affinity measurement details required for the TSV format.

If you would like me to extract data in this format, I would need a different scientific literature text that more directly reports ligand-receptor binding measurements.
