Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

```
Eglin c	Human leukocyte elastase	Hirudo medicinalis	Ka=1.0 x 10^11 M^-1	enzyme activity assay	1HEG
Eglin c	Bovine ¦Á-chymotrypsin	Bos taurus	Ka=5.0 x 10^9 M^-1	enzyme activity assay	NA
Eglin c	Subtilisin Carlsberg	NA	Ka=6.6 x 10^9 M^-1	enzyme activity assay	NA
```

Notes on the extraction:
- Ligand name is consistently "Eglin c"
- Receptor proteins are Human leukocyte elastase, Bovine ¦Á-chymotrypsin, and Subtilisin Carlsberg
- Organism sources are extracted where possible (Hirudo medicinalis for eglin c, Bos taurus for bovine chymotrypsin)
- Affinity values are taken from Table I, using Ka (association constant)
- Wet lab method is "enzyme activity assay" based on the description in the Methods section
- PDB ID is only available for the human leukocyte elastase complex (1HEG), marked as NA for others where not specified

The data follows the specified 6-column TSV format, extracting information directly from the text without inference or tampering.
