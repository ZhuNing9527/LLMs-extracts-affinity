Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I apologize, but after carefully reviewing the provided text, I cannot extract the requested data in the specified TSV format. The text appears to be a fragment of a scientific publication's metadata or header, and does not contain the specific details required for the extraction task, such as:

- Ligand name
- Receptor protein name
- Receptor protein organism source
- Affinity value
- Wet lab method for affinity measurement
- Corresponding complex PDBID

The text seems to be a bibliographic reference for an article about Matrix Metalloproteinase inhibitors, but lacks the specific experimental details needed to populate the requested columns.

To successfully complete this task, I would need:
1. The full text of the scientific literature
2. A more complete converted text that includes experimental details

Would you like to provide the full text of the scientific literature for extraction?
