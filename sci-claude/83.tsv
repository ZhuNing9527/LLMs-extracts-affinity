Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll help you extract the data from the scientific literature text. Based on the requirements, I'll carefully scan the text for the specified information. However, in this particular text, I did not find any direct measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity that match the required output format.

The text is a detailed molecular biology research paper about the TGF receptor activation process, focusing on the molecular mechanisms of Smad2 phosphorylation by the type I TGF receptor (TR-I). While the paper discusses protein interactions and phosphorylation, it does not provide specific affinity measurements in the requested format.

If you would like me to extract data, I would need a text that contains explicit affinity measurements with the specified details. This current text is more of a mechanistic study of protein interactions rather than a binding affinity characterization.

Would you like me to explain the key findings of this paper instead, or do you have another text with the specific affinity data you're seeking?
