Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there are no direct measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity that match the exact requirements. The paper is primarily about the structural characterization of the Alanine-Glyoxylate Aminotransferase (AGT) protein and its interaction with the Pex5p receptor.

The closest relevant information I can extract is:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Alanine-Glyoxylate Aminotransferase (AGT)	Pex5p	Homo sapiens	Kd=3.5 ?M	Isothermal titration microcalorimetry	3R9A
```

Key details supporting this extraction:
- The paper describes the interaction between AGT and Pex5p receptor
- The organism source is human (Homo sapiens)
- The affinity was measured using isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC)
- The dissociation constant (Kd) is reported as 3.5 ?M in Table 1
- The complex structure was deposited with PDB ID 3R9A

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this extraction?
