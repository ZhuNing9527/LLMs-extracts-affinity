Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll help you extract the data from the scientific literature text. Based on the requirements, I'll create a TSV output with the specified columns.

After carefully reviewing the text, I found one potential entry:

```tsv
Rac1	p67phox	Homo sapiens	Kd=2.7 ?M	isothermal titration calorimetry	None
```

Explanation of the extraction:
1. Ligand name: Rac1 (the small GTPase)
2. Receptor protein name: p67phox
3. Receptor protein organism source: Homo sapiens
4. Affinity value: Kd=2.7 ?M (from the isothermal titration calorimetry results)
5. Wet lab method: isothermal titration calorimetry
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: None (no PDB ID was explicitly mentioned in the text)

Note that this is the only clear affinity measurement I could extract from the text. The paper describes a structural study of the Rac1/p67phox interaction, and the 2.7 ?M value is for the binding affinity of Rac1¡¤Q61L¡¤GTP to the N-terminal domain of p67phox.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the extraction?
