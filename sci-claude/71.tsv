Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text provided, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there are no clear measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity. The text is primarily about the structural analysis of HspBP1 (Hsp70 binding protein 1) and its interaction with Hsp70 chaperone proteins.

Since no direct affinity measurements are present, I cannot generate a meaningful TSV output. The text discusses protein interactions and structural mechanisms, but does not provide specific binding affinity values in the format requested (e.g., Kd, Ki, IC50).

If you would like me to extract data, I would need a different scientific literature text that contains explicit affinity measurements between ligands and receptors.
