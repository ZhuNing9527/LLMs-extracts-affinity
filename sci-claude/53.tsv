Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following data for extraction:

```tsv
NC41 antibody	Neuraminidase (NA)	Influenza virus A/tern/Australia/G70c/75	Ka=4 ¡Á 10^8 M-1	enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)	1NCA
```

Let me break down the extraction for each column:

1. Ligand name: NC41 antibody
2. Receptor protein name: Neuraminidase (NA)
3. Receptor protein organism source: Influenza virus A/tern/Australia/G70c/75
4. Affinity value: Ka=4 ¡Á 10^8 M-1
5. Wet lab method for affinity measurement: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: 1NCA

The affinity value is derived from the text: "The Ka for NC41 Ab binding to G70c NA is 4 ¡Á 108 M-1" and the method is described in the ELISA section of the paper.
