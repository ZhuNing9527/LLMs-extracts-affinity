Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, the text appears to be a detailed scientific paper about Fc receptors and their binding properties, which does not directly list multiple ligand-receptor interactions in the format requested.

From the text, I can extract one potential entry:

```
Fc fragment	FcRIIa	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.56 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	NA
```

Notes:
- The ligand is the Fc fragment of human IgG1
- The receptor is FcRIIa 
- Organism source is Homo sapiens
- Affinity is measured as Kd=0.56 ?M
- Method is surface plasmon resonance
- No PDB ID was provided in the text

Would you like me to clarify anything about this extraction or explain the limitations of extracting more entries from this specific scientific text?
