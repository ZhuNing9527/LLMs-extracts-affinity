Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text and format it as a TSV with the specified columns. Based on the text, I found one relevant data point:

```tsv
Barnase	Barstar	Bacillus amyloliquefaciens	Kd=6 ¡Á 10^-13 M	isothermal titration calorimetry	N/A
```

Notes:
- The text describes the binding between barnase and barstar proteins from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens
- The dissociation constant (Kd) is reported as 6 ¡Á 10^-13 M
- The method appears to be a combination of titration and calorimetry
- No specific PDB ID is mentioned for the complex

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
1. Ligand name: Barnase
2. Receptor protein name: Barstar
3. Receptor protein organism source: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens
4. Affinity value: Kd=6 ¡Á 10^-13 M
5. Wet lab method: isothermal titration calorimetry
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: N/A
