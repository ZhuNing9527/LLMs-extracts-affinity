Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following data for extraction:

Ligand name: Nb4 (nanobody)
Receptor protein name: Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)
Receptor protein organism source: Homo sapiens
Affinity value: Kd = 54 pM
Wet lab method for affinity measurement: Surface plasmon resonance
Corresponding complex PDBID: 5HGG

Here's the output in TSV format:

```
Nb4	Urokinase-type plasminogen activator	Homo sapiens	Kd=54 pM	Surface plasmon resonance	5HGG
```

Note: 
- The data is extracted directly from the text, specifically from the Surface Plasmon Resonance section and the crystallography details.
- The affinity value is derived from the SPR analysis, which showed a KD of 54 pM for Nb4 binding to two-chain uPA.
- The PDB ID is from the data deposition section of the paper.
