Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I apologize, but I cannot find any ligand-receptor binding affinity data in this scientific literature text that matches the specified output requirements. The text appears to be a detailed molecular biology research paper about the Sir1 protein in yeast and its role in chromatin silencing. It does not contain information about ligand-receptor interactions with affinity measurements.

The output requirements specify extracting:
1. Ligand name
2. Receptor protein name
3. Receptor protein organism source
4. Affinity value
5. Wet lab method for affinity measurement
6. Corresponding complex PDBID

This paper does not provide data matching those specific columns. The text is focused on analyzing the structural and functional properties of the Sir1 protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, discussing its interactions with other proteins like Orc1 and Sir3, but not presenting ligand-receptor binding affinity measurements.

Would you like me to explain the scientific content of this paper instead?
