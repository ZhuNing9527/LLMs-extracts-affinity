Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there are no direct measurements of ligand-receptor interactions with affinity values. The text is primarily about BRCT domain interactions in DNA repair proteins, focusing on structural and interaction characteristics of XRCC1, LigIII, and PARP1 proteins.

Since no direct affinity measurements are present, I cannot generate a TSV output with the requested columns. The text describes protein-protein interactions and complex formation, but does not provide specific affinity values like Kd, Ki, or IC50 for a ligand-receptor pair.

If you would like me to extract other relevant information from the text, such as protein interactions or domain characteristics, I can do so. Would you like me to proceed with an alternative extraction approach?
