Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there are no direct measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity. The paper focuses on enzymatic kinetics of deubiquitinating enzymes (UCH-L3 and IPaseT) with ubiquitin-derived substrates.

The closest relevant data points I can extract are:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Ubiquitin C-terminal 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC)	UCH-L3	Rabbit	Km=38.6 nM	Fluorescence spectrophotometry	N/A
Ubiquitin C-terminal 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC)	Isopeptidase T	Rabbit	Km=1.4 ??M	Fluorescence spectrophotometry	N/A
Ubiquitin aldehyde (Ub-H)	UCH-L3	Rabbit	Ki<50 pM	Enzyme inhibition assay	N/A
```

Notes:
- The values are kinetic parameters (Km, Ki) rather than direct binding affinity measurements
- No PDB complex IDs were provided
- The organism source is Rabbit for both enzymes
- The wet lab method was fluorescence spectrophotometry for substrate kinetics and enzyme inhibition assay for the inhibitor

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the extraction?
