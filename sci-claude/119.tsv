Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
HIV-1 capsid protein	Cyclophilin A	Homo sapiens	Kd=16 ?M	isothermal titration calorimetry	Not specified
HIV-1 capsid protein (CA151)	Cyclophilin A	Homo sapiens	Kd=16 ?M	isothermal titration calorimetry	Not specified
```

Key observations:
- The text describes the interaction between the HIV-1 capsid protein and human Cyclophilin A
- Two measurements are reported: one for full-length capsid protein (CA) and one for truncated capsid protein (CA151)
- The affinity is consistently measured at Kd=16 ?M
- The primary method of affinity measurement was isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
- No specific PDB complex ID was mentioned in the text

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
1. Ligand name is the HIV-1 capsid protein
2. Receptor protein name is Cyclophilin A
3. Organism source is Homo sapiens
4. Affinity value is in the specified Kd format
5. Wet lab method is isothermal titration calorimetry
6. No corresponding complex PDBID was provided
