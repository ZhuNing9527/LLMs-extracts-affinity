Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following data for extraction:

```tsv
HIV-1 Nef	Hck SH3 domain	Homo sapiens	Kd=1.5 ?M	isothermal titration calorimetry	N/A
HIV-1 Nef	Fyn SH3 domain	Homo sapiens	Kd=15.8 ?M	isothermal titration calorimetry	N/A
HIV-1 Nef	Lck SH3 domain	Homo sapiens	Kd=10.6 ?M	isothermal titration calorimetry	N/A
HIV-1 Nef	Src SH3 domain	Homo sapiens	Kd=14.3 ?M	isothermal titration calorimetry	N/A
```

Notes:
- The organism source is Homo sapiens for all entries, as these are human proteins
- The affinity values are derived from the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments reported in Table 1
- No corresponding PDB complex IDs were provided in the text, so I've used N/A
- The full-length Nef measurements were similar, so I've used the Nef?1-57 measurements
- The wet lab method for all entries is isothermal titration calorimetry
