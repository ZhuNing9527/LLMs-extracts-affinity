Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following data points:

```tsv
Actin	G-actin	Homo sapiens	Kd=4.5 x 10^-12 M	isothermal titration calorimetry	N/A
Actin	G-actin	Homo sapiens	Kd=25 nM	isothermal titration calorimetry	N/A
```

Explanation:
1. The first row represents the interaction between the 14NT fragment and G-actin, with a Kd of 4.5 x 10^-12 M.
2. The second row represents the interaction between the 41CT fragment and G-actin, with a Kd of 25 nM.

Both measurements were performed using methods similar to isothermal titration calorimetry, specifically by studying the exchange of etheno-ATP from G-actin. The organism source is Homo sapiens, as the gelsolin was purified from human plasma. No corresponding PDB IDs were mentioned in the text.

Note: The text does not provide a comprehensive list of all ligand-receptor interactions, but these are the most clearly quantified interactions in the provided scientific literature.
