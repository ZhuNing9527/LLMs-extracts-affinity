Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, here's the TSV output:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
HIV-1 Nef protein	Hck SH3 domain	Homo sapiens	Kd=250 nM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
HIV-1 Nef protein	Fyn SH3 domain	Homo sapiens	Kd>20 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
HIV-1 Nef PxxP peptide	Hck SH3 domain	Homo sapiens	Kd=91 ?M	tryptophan fluorescence	N/A
HIV-1 Nef PxxP peptide	Fyn SH3 domain	Homo sapiens	Kd=202 ?M	tryptophan fluorescence	N/A
```

Notes:
- The data is extracted directly from the literature text
- Each line represents a unique wet test measurement of affinity
- The columns follow the specified order
- No PDBID was provided in the text, so "N/A" is used
- Affinity values are reported in the specified format
- Wet lab methods are directly quoted from the text
