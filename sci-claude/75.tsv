Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text provided, I'll extract the data according to the specified requirements:

Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Somatomedin B domain	Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)	Homo sapiens	Kd=1 nM	Fluorescence titration	1OC0

Explanation of extraction:
1. Ligand name: Somatomedin B domain (from vitronectin)
2. Receptor protein name: Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)
3. Receptor protein organism source: Homo sapiens (human)
4. Affinity value: Kd=1 nM (directly stated in the text)
5. Wet lab method: Fluorescence titration (mentioned in the methods section)
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: 1OC0 (provided in the coordinates section)

The extraction follows the specified guidelines:
- Data is extracted directly from the literature
- Output is in TSV format
- Exactly 6 columns are used
- Each line represents one wet test measurement of affinity
