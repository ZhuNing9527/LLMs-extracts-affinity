Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following extraction:

```tsv
Ubiquitin	EDD UBA domain	Homo sapiens	Kd=60 ?M	isothermal titration calorimetry	2QHO
```

Explanation of the extraction:
1. Ligand name: "Ubiquitin"
2. Receptor protein name: "EDD UBA domain"
3. Receptor protein organism source: "Homo sapiens"
4. Affinity value: "Kd=60 ?M" (from the ITC measurement section)
5. Wet lab method: "isothermal titration calorimetry"
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: "2QHO" (mentioned in the paper's acknowledgments)

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
- Extracted directly from the literature
- In TSV format
- 6 columns in the specified order
- Affinity value follows the required format
- Wet lab method is a recognized technique
