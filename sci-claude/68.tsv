Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, here's the TSV output:

```
Efb-C	C3d	Homo sapiens	Kd=2 nM	isothermal titration calorimetry	2GOX
```

Explanation of the extraction:
1. Ligand name: Efb-C (Staphylococcus aureus extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein C-terminal domain)
2. Receptor protein name: C3d (complement component 3d)
3. Receptor protein organism source: Homo sapiens (human)
4. Affinity value: Kd=2 nM (from the isothermal titration calorimetry results in Table 2)
5. Wet lab method for affinity measurement: isothermal titration calorimetry
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: 2GOX (from Figure 1A's PDB accession code)

The extraction follows the guidelines of directly using data from the text without inference or tampering, and presents the information in the specified 6-column TSV format.
