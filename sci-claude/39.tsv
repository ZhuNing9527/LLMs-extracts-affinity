Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll help you extract the data from the scientific literature text. Based on the requirements, I'll create a TSV output with the specified columns.

Here's the extracted data in TSV format:

```tsv
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
TdPI	¦Â-tryptase	Homo sapiens	Ki=55 nM	enzyme activity assay	2UUY
TdPI	trypsin	Bos taurus	Ki=5.6 nM	enzyme activity assay	2UUY
```

Explanation of the extraction:

1. Ligand name: TdPI (Tick-derived Protease Inhibitor)
2. Receptor protein names: 
   - ¦Â-tryptase (human)
   - trypsin (bovine)
3. Receptor protein organism sources:
   - Homo sapiens (for ¦Â-tryptase)
   - Bos taurus (for trypsin)
4. Affinity values:
   - For human ¦Â-tryptase: Ki=55 nM
   - For trypsin: Ki=5.6 nM
5. Wet lab method: enzyme activity assay (as described in the "Inhibition assays" section)
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: 2UUY (from the Protein Data Bank accession codes section)

Note: The data is extracted directly from the text, following the specified requirements. The values are based on the experimental results reported in the scientific literature.
