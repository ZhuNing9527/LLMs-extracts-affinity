Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the provided scientific literature text, I cannot extract any ligand-receptor binding affinity data in the requested TSV format. The text appears to be a scientific paper about gene cloning and expression of a trypsin inhibitor (CMTI I) in E. coli, but it does not contain specific binding affinity measurements that meet the extraction criteria.

The text discusses:
- Synthesis of a modified Cucurbita maxima trypsin inhibitor (Leu-8-CMTI I)
- Gene cloning and expression methods
- Protein purification techniques

While the abstract mentions "Association constants of recombinant Leu-8-CMTI I with bovine ??-trypsin and human cathepsin G", no specific affinity values are provided in the text.

To extract the requested data, I would need:
1. Precise affinity values (Kd, Ki, IC50)
2. Specific wet lab measurement method
3. Corresponding PDB ID (if available)

None of these details are present in the given text. If you have additional text or a different section of the paper, I'd be happy to help extract the data according to the specified requirements.
