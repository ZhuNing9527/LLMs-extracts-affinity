Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there is only one set of data that can be extracted:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor (LCI)	Carboxypeptidase A	Bos taurus (Bovine)	Ki=1.1 nM	enzyme activity assay	1DTD
Leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor (LCI)	Carboxypeptidase A1	Homo sapiens	Ki=1.3 nM	enzyme activity assay	N/A
Leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor (LCI)	Carboxypeptidase B	Sus scrofa (Porcine)	Ki=2.4 nM	enzyme activity assay	N/A
Leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor (LCI)	Carboxypeptidase B	Homo sapiens	Ki=1.2 nM	enzyme activity assay	N/A
```

Notes:
- The data is extracted directly from Table 2 in the text
- The wet lab method is inferred from the description of the inhibition constant (Ki) measurement in the "CP inhibitory assays" section
- The organism sources are added based on the species names mentioned
- The complex PDBID is taken from the text (1DTD for the LCI-CPA complex), with N/A for entries without a specific PDB reference
- The affinity values are Ki values from the enzyme activity assay
