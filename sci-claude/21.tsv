Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
HPr	Jel42 monoclonal antibody	Mus musculus	Kd=2.8 nM	fluorescence polarization	ND
HPr	Jel42 Fab fragment	Mus musculus	Kd=3.7 nM	fluorescence polarization	ND
HPr	Jel44 monoclonal antibody	Mus musculus	Kd=5.1 nM	fluorescence polarization	ND
HPr	Jel44 Fab fragment	Mus musculus	Kd=6.3 nM	fluorescence polarization	ND
HPr	Jel323 monoclonal antibody	Mus musculus	Kd=5.7 nM	fluorescence polarization	ND
HPr	Jel323 Fab fragment	Mus musculus	Kd=5.1 nM	fluorescence polarization	ND

Notes:
- ND (Not Determined) is used for the complex PDBID as no specific PDB ID was mentioned in the text
- Organism source is Mus musculus (mouse) as these are monoclonal antibodies
- Wet lab method is fluorescence polarization for all measurements
- Affinity values are reported as Kd (dissociation constant) in nM
- Ligand is consistently HPr (histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein)
