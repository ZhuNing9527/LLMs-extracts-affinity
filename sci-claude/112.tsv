Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, after carefully reviewing the text, I did not find any specific ligand-receptor binding affinity measurements that meet the exact requirements of the 6 columns.

The text is primarily about the development of a recombinant vaccinia virus (vvDD-A34R-hCCL5) expressing human CCL5 chemokine, and describes its production and characterization for potential clinical use. While it discusses the virus and CCL5 expression, it does not provide specific ligand-receptor binding affinity data.

Therefore, I cannot generate a TSV output with the requested columns. If you would like me to extract other types of information from this text, please let me know.
