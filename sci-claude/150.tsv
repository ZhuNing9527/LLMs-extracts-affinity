Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, I notice that this paper is a detailed study of BPTI (Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor) mutations and its interactions with trypsin and chymotrypsin, so the data will be specific to this protein system.

Here's the extracted data in TSV format:

```
Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (wild-type)	¦Â-Trypsin	Bos taurus	Kd=5¡Á10^-14 M	enzyme activity assay	1PTI
Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (Lys-15-Ala mutant)	¦Â-Trypsin	Bos taurus	Kd=1.4¡Á10^-6 M	enzyme activity assay	1PTI
Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (wild-type)	¦Á-Chymotrypsin	Bos taurus	Kd=1.8¡Á10^-3 M	enzyme activity assay	1PTI
Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (Lys-15-Ala mutant)	¦Á-Chymotrypsin	Bos taurus	Kd=3.3¡Á10^-7 M	enzyme activity assay	1PTI
```

Key notes:
1. The data is extracted directly from the scientific literature text.
2. The affinity values are reported as equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd).
3. The wet lab method is enzyme activity assay, which involves monitoring the release of p-nitroanilide at 405 nm.
4. The organism source is Bos taurus (cattle) for both the protein and the enzyme.
5. The complex PDBID is 1PTI for all entries.
