Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the provided scientific literature text, I cannot extract any specific ligand-receptor binding affinity data that meets the exact requirements of the TSV format. The text appears to be an introduction to a scientific paper about hemoglobin capture by Staphylococcus aureus, discussing iron acquisition mechanisms, but does not provide explicit affinity measurements.

The text discusses:
- Hemoglobin (Hb) as an iron source
- Staphylococcus aureus iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins
- Mechanisms of bacterial iron scavenging

However, it lacks the specific details required for the TSV output, such as:
- Precise ligand name
- Exact receptor protein name
- Specific affinity value
- Wet lab method for affinity measurement
- Complex PDB ID

If you have the full text of the scientific literature, including methods or results sections, I would be happy to help extract the required data. This excerpt appears to be only the introduction, which typically does not contain detailed binding affinity measurements.
