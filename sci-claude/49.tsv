Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll help you extract the data from the scientific literature text. However, I noticed that this particular text does not contain any direct ligand-receptor binding affinity measurements. The text is a scientific paper about the role of the TusA protein in sulfur transfer and molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.

Since there are no ligand-receptor binding affinity measurements in this text, I cannot generate a TSV output with the requested columns. The paper is primarily a biochemical and molecular biology study about protein function and gene regulation.

Would you like me to explain the key findings of this paper instead? Or do you have another text you'd like me to extract binding affinity data from?
