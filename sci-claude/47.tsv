Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following data points:

```tsv
Transducin ¦Á subunit (Gat)	RGS9	Bos taurus (bovine)	Kd=185 nM	fluorescence assay	N/A
```

Explanation of the extraction:
1. Ligand name: Transducin ¦Á subunit (Gat)
2. Receptor protein name: RGS9
3. Receptor protein organism source: Bos taurus (bovine), as the study used bovine retinal RGS9
4. Affinity value: Kd=185 nM (from the text: "The Kd of the Gat-AlF4 2zRGS9 complex calculated from the competition curve was 185 ¡À 8 nM")
5. Wet lab method: fluorescence assay (using a fluorescent labeled chimeric protein Chi6b-LY)
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: Not available (N/A) in the text

Note: The text does not provide a PDB ID for the complex, so I've marked it as N/A. The extraction is based directly on the information in the scientific literature, without inference or tampering.
