Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
IL-13R111Q	IL-13	Homo sapiens	Kd=50 pM	surface plasmon resonance	3L5W
IL-13R111Q	IL-13	Homo sapiens	Kd=8 pM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
```

Explanation:
1. The first row represents the original mouse antibody (m836) interaction with IL-13, with an affinity of 50 pM.
2. The second row represents the optimized antibody variant (M460) with an improved affinity of 8 pM.

Key observations:
- The ligand is the IL-13R111Q variant
- The receptor protein is IL-13
- The organism source is Homo sapiens
- Affinity was measured using surface plasmon resonance
- The first entry has a corresponding PDB complex ID of 3L5W
- The second entry does not have a specific PDB complex ID

The data is extracted directly from the scientific literature text, following the specified requirements for the TSV format.
