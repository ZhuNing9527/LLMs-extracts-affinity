Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text provided, I'll extract the data according to the specified requirements. Here's the TSV output:

```
Lymphotactin	M3 decoy receptor	Mus musculus	Kd=Not specified	Surface plasmon resonance	Not specified
Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (CCL2)	M3 decoy receptor	Mus musculus	Kd=Not specified	Surface plasmon resonance	Not specified
```

Notes on the extraction:
- The text describes structural studies of the M3 decoy receptor from mouse ??-herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) binding to two chemokines: Lymphotactin (XCL1) and Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (CCL2)
- The organism source is Mus musculus (mouse)
- Specific Kd values are not provided in the text
- The method appears to be surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based on the structural and binding kinetics analysis
- No PDB IDs were explicitly mentioned in the text for these specific complexes

The output follows the specified 6-column TSV format, with available information filled in and "Not specified" used where precise data is missing.
