Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
SpG1	Fc fragment of human IgG1	Homo sapiens	Kd=306 nM	fluorescence spectroscopy	Not provided
SpG1	Fc fragment of human IgG1	Homo sapiens	Kd=333 nM	isothermal titration calorimetry	Not provided
SpAB*-1	Fc fragment of human IgG1	Homo sapiens	Kd=22.5 nM	fluorescence spectroscopy	Not provided
SpAB*-1	Fc fragment of human IgG1	Homo sapiens	Kd=40 nM	ELISA	Not provided

Notes:
- The data is extracted directly from the text as requested
- No inferences or additional information were added
- The output follows the specified 6-column TSV format
- Affinity values are reported in the specified format
- Wet lab methods are extracted from the text
- No complex PDBID was provided in the text, so that column is left blank
