Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there are no direct measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity that match the exact requirements. The text is primarily about the kinetic interactions of proteins in the CYP11A1 electron transfer system.

The closest relevant data I can extract is:

```
Adx	AdR	Bos taurus	Kd=0.856 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
Adx	CYP11A1	Bos taurus	Kd=0.0134 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
```

Notes:
- The organism source is Bos taurus (bovine)
- Kd values are derived from surface plasmon resonance measurements
- No specific PDB IDs are mentioned
- The proteins are adrenodoxin (Adx), adrenodoxin reductase (AdR), and cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1)

Would you like me to elaborate on the data extraction or explain the context of these protein interactions?
