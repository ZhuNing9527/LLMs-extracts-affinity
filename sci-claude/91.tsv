Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, I notice that this particular text is a detailed scientific paper about Ras and PI3Kg interactions, and does not contain multiple distinct ligand-receptor binding measurements. I'll extract the most relevant information available:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
H-Ras	Phosphoinositide 3-kinase ¦Ã (PI3K¦Ã)	Homo sapiens	Not explicitly stated	Multiple methods (in vitro activation, fluorescence anisotropy, crystallography)	Not provided in text
```

Key observations:
- The text describes interactions between H-Ras and PI3K¦Ã
- Multiple experimental methods were used to characterize the interaction
- No explicit Kd or binding affinity value was directly stated in the text
- The complex was structurally characterized, but no specific PDB ID was mentioned for the Ras-PI3K¦Ã complex

The extraction is limited because the text is a detailed mechanistic study rather than a compilation of binding measurements. A more comprehensive extraction would require additional literature sources.
