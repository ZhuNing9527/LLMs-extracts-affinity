Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, I notice that this paper is primarily about structural analysis of an antibody (scFv) against CXCL13, and does not provide a comprehensive affinity measurement across multiple ligands and receptors.

I'll extract the key information available:

```
CXCL13	anti-CXCL13 scFv	Homo sapiens	Kd=pM range	surface plasmon resonance	5C2B
```

Notes:
- The ligand is CXCL13 (a chemokine)
- The receptor protein is the anti-CXCL13 single-chain variable fragment (scFv)
- The organism source is human (Homo sapiens)
- The affinity is in the picomolar (pM) range, though an exact value is not specified
- The binding kinetics were measured by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore)
- The corresponding PDB complex ID is 5C2B

The paper focuses more on the structural optimization of the antibody rather than providing a comprehensive affinity measurement table. If you need more detailed affinity data, you may want to consult additional sources or the original experimental data.
