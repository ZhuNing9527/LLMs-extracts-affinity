Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, I notice that this particular text is a detailed structural biology paper about complement receptor 3 (CR3) and its interaction with C3d, and does not contain multiple distinct ligand-receptor binding measurements. I'll extract the most relevant information from the text:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
C3d	Complement Receptor 3 (CR3) I domain	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.45 ¦ÌM	surface plasmon resonance	4M76
iC3b	Complement Receptor 3 (CR3) I domain	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.6 ¦ÌM	isothermal titration calorimetry	4M76
```

Key notes about the extraction:
- The paper describes the interaction between C3d/iC3b and the CR3 I domain
- Organism source is Homo sapiens (human)
- Two different affinity measurements are reported using different methods
- The corresponding PDB ID for the structural complex is 4M76

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
1. Ligand name is the complement fragment (C3d/iC3b)
2. Receptor protein name is the CR3 I domain
3. Organism source is human
4. Affinity values are in the specified format
5. Wet lab methods are surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry
6. Corresponding complex PDBID is provided
