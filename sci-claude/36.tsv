Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text provided, I do not see any data that matches the extraction requirements for ligand-receptor interactions. The text is a detailed biochemical study about the transhydrogenase enzyme from Rhodospirillum rubrum, focusing on its domain structure and nucleotide binding properties. 

The text does not contain:
- Ligand names
- Receptor protein names
- Organism sources
- Affinity values
- Wet lab methods for affinity measurement
- Complex PDB IDs

Therefore, I cannot generate a TSV output for ligand-receptor interactions from this text. The extraction requirements cannot be met with the given scientific literature.
