Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, I notice that this particular text is a structural biology paper about Hsp90 and p50cdc37 protein interactions, and does not contain direct ligand-receptor affinity measurements. Therefore, I cannot populate a full TSV with the requested columns.

Here's an explanation of why I cannot complete the full extraction:

1. The text is about the structural mechanism of protein-protein interaction between Hsp90 and p50cdc37.
2. There are no explicit ligand-receptor affinity measurements reported.
3. The paper does not list specific ligand names, receptor protein organism sources, affinity values, wet lab methods, or PDB IDs for protein-ligand complexes.

If you would like me to extract data, I would need a different scientific literature text that contains the specific affinity measurement details you're seeking.

Would you like me to:
1. Confirm the extraction requirements?
2. Explain what kind of text would be suitable for this extraction?
3. Provide an example of how the TSV would look if data were present?
