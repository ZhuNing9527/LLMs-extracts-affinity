Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Actin	DNAase I	Bos taurus (Bovine)	Kd=5 x 10^8 M^-1	Not specified	Not specified
Actin (monomeric)	DNAase I	Bos taurus (Bovine)	Kd=5 x 10^8 M^-1	Fluorescence titration	Not specified
Actin (filamentous)	DNAase I	Bos taurus (Bovine)	Kd=1.2 x 10^4 M^-1	Cosedimentation	Not specified
```

Notes:
- The data is extracted directly from the text
- Binding constants are reported as reciprocal molar concentrations (M^-1)
- The organism source is Bos taurus (Bovine) for both DNAase I and actin
- Wet lab methods include fluorescence titration and cosedimentation
- No specific PDB ID was mentioned in the text
- The values represent binding constants for different forms of actin (monomeric and filamentous) with DNAase I
