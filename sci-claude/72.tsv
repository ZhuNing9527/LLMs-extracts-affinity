Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I apologize, but after carefully reviewing the provided text, I cannot extract the requested data for the TSV format. The text appears to be a fragment of a scientific publication metadata or reference section, but it does not contain:
- Specific ligand names
- Receptor protein names
- Organism sources
- Affinity values
- Wet lab methods
- Complex PDB IDs

The text seems to be a bibliographic reference for a scientific paper about protein interactions (specifically mentioning Core Binding Factor), but lacks the detailed experimental data required to populate the 6 columns.

To successfully complete this task, I would need the full text of the scientific literature, particularly the methods, results, or discussion sections where experimental details are typically reported.

If you have the full text of the scientific literature, please provide it, and I'll be happy to help extract the requested data precisely and accurately.
