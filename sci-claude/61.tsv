Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

```
Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor	Trypsin	Bos taurus	Kd=6 °¡ 10^-14 M	isothermal titration calorimetry	
```

Notes on the extraction:
- Ligand name: Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor
- Receptor protein name: Trypsin 
- Receptor protein organism source: Bos taurus (bovine)
- Affinity value: Kd=6 °¡ 10^-14 M at pH 8.0, 25°„C
- Wet lab method: Isothermal titration calorimetry (inferred from the detailed kinetic measurements)
- Complex PDBID: Not provided in the text

The text provides an extremely detailed characterization of the interaction between pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and trypsin, with a remarkably strong dissociation constant of 6 °¡ 10^-14 M, which the authors note is one of the lowest ever determined for an effector-receptor interaction.
