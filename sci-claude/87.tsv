Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there are no direct measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity that fully match all the requested columns. The text is primarily about mutations in the Heparin Cofactor II (HCII) protein and its interaction with thrombin.

I'll provide the most relevant information I can extract:

```
Heparin Cofactor II (HCII)	Thrombin	Homo sapiens	Kd not directly measured	Enzyme activity assay	Not provided
```

Key observations:
1. The text is a detailed study about HCII protein mutations (R200A and R200E) and their effect on thrombin inhibition.
2. While the paper discusses protein-protein interactions, it does not provide a direct Kd or Ki measurement.
3. The wet lab methods include enzyme activity assays and slow binding kinetics.
4. No PDB ID is mentioned for the protein complex.

The extraction is limited because the text is a mechanistic study of protein interactions rather than a direct affinity measurement report. A more targeted affinity measurement paper would be needed to fully populate all requested columns.
