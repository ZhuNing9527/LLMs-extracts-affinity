Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I apologize, but I cannot extract the specific data points you're requesting from this text. The provided text appears to be a partial bibliographic reference with some author names and publication details, but it lacks clear, extractable information about:
- Ligand names
- Receptor protein names
- Organism sources
- Affinity values
- Wet lab methods
- Complex PDB IDs

To successfully extract the requested data, I would need:
1. A more complete scientific text describing the actual experimental results
2. Clearer details about the specific molecular interactions
3. Explicit statements about binding affinities, methods, and protein details

If you have the full text of the scientific literature, I recommend providing that complete text so I can accurately extract the requested information according to the specified TSV format and column requirements.

Would you like to provide the full text of the scientific literature for extraction?
