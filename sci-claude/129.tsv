Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

```
Hirustasin	Tissue kallikrein	Hirudo medicinalis	Ki=13 nM	Not specified	N/A
Hirustasin	Trypsin (bovine)	Bos taurus	Ki=7 nM	Not specified	N/A
Hirustasin	Chymotrypsin (bovine)	Bos taurus	Ki=6.4 nM	Not specified	N/A
Hirustasin	Cathepsin G (human)	Homo sapiens	Ki=2.9 nM	Not specified	N/A
Hirustasin	Plasmin (human)	Homo sapiens	Ki=138 nM	Not specified	N/A
```

Notes:
- The wet lab method for affinity measurement was not explicitly specified in the text
- No corresponding PDB complex ID was provided
- The organism sources are inferred from the species mentioned in the text
- Affinity values are reported as Ki (inhibition constant) in nanomolar range
- The data represents the inhibition of various proteases by Hirustasin from the medical leech Hirudo medicinalis
