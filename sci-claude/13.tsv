Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
CD8aa	HLA-A2	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.2 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
CD8aa	HLA-A2	Homo sapiens	Kd=150 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
CD8aa	HLA-A2	Homo sapiens	Kd=200 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
```

Key observations:
- The data is extracted directly from the text
- Multiple measurements of CD8aa binding to HLA-A2 are reported
- Affinity values are reported at different temperatures (25°„C and 37°„C)
- The wet lab method is consistently surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
- No specific PDB ID was mentioned in the text, so I've used N/A
- The organism source is Homo sapiens for the HLA-A2 molecule

The extraction follows the specified 6-column format, with each line representing a distinct affinity measurement from the scientific literature.
