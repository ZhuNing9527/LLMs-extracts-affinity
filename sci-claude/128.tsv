Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Adenovirus Type 21 knob	CD46	Homo sapiens	Kd=284 nM	surface plasmon resonance	3L89
```

Key observations:
- The text describes the interaction between the Adenovirus Type 21 knob and the CD46 receptor
- The affinity was measured using surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
- The complex structure was deposited with PDB ID 3L89
- The receptor protein is from Homo sapiens (human)

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
1. Directly extracted from the literature text
2. Output in TSV format
3. Exactly 6 columns in the specified order
4. No inferred or tampered data
