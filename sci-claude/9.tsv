Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following extraction:

```
Erythropoietin (EPO)	Erythropoietin receptor (EPOR)	Homo sapiens	Kd=3.7 pM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
```

Notes on the extraction:
1. Ligand name: Erythropoietin (EPO)
2. Receptor protein name: Erythropoietin receptor (EPOR)
3. Receptor protein organism source: Homo sapiens
4. Affinity value: Kd=3.7 pM (from Table 2, calculated as koff/kon)
5. Wet lab method: surface plasmon resonance
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: Not provided in the text (marked as N/A)

The extraction follows the specified TSV format with exactly 6 columns. The data is extracted directly from the literature without inference or tampering, as requested.
