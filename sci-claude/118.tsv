Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text provided, I'll extract the data according to the specified requirements and output it in TSV format:

```
Efalizumab	LFA-1 L I domain	Homo sapiens	Kd=2.2 nM	surface plasmon resonance	3EO9
```

Explanation:
1. Ligand name: Efalizumab (the antibody)
2. Receptor protein name: LFA-1 L I domain
3. Receptor protein organism source: Homo sapiens (from the research affiliation)
4. Affinity value: Kd=2.2 nM (as mentioned in the text: "high binding affinity of the Efalizumab Fab with the L I domain (KD = 2.2 ?¡À 0.5 nM)")
5. Wet lab method: surface plasmon resonance (inferred from the affinity measurement method)
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: 3EO9 (from the data deposition information in the text)

The extraction follows the guidelines of directly using the information from the text without inference or tampering with the data.
