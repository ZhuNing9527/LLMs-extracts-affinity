Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll help you extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, here's the TSV output:

```
Engineered lipocalin	CTLA-4	Homo sapiens	Kd=240 pM	surface plasmon resonance	3BX7
```

Explanation of the extraction:
1. Ligand name: "Engineered lipocalin" (specifically the variant PRS-010#005)
2. Receptor protein name: CTLA-4
3. Receptor protein organism source: Homo sapiens
4. Affinity value: Kd=240 pM (from the text: "exhibit KD values of 2.7 nM and even of 240 pM")
5. Wet lab method: surface plasmon resonance (Biacore analysis mentioned in the text)
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: 3BX7 (from the text: "Data deposition: The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, www.pdb.org (PDB ID codes 3BX7 and 3BX8)")

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
- Directly extracted from the literature
- No inference or tampering with the data
- TSV format
- 6 columns in the specified order
- Each line represents one wet test measurement of affinity
