Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
MK2a 370-400 peptide	p38¦Á	Mus musculus	Kd=8.4 nM	stopped-flow fluorescence	N/A
MK2a 370-400 peptide	p38¦Á	Mus musculus	Kd=1.0 nM	stopped-flow fluorescence	N/A
6His-MK2a 51-400	p38¦Á	Mus musculus	Kd=3.3 nM	stopped-flow fluorescence	N/A
GST-MK2a 1-400	p38¦Á	Mus musculus	Kd=2.5 nM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
```

Notes:
- The data is extracted directly from the literature text
- Each line represents a unique wet lab measurement of affinity
- The columns follow the specified order
- No complex PDBID was mentioned in the text, so N/A is used
- Multiple measurements for the same ligand-receptor pair are included as separate lines
- Organism source is Mus musculus (mouse) as the proteins were derived from murine sources
- Wet lab methods include stopped-flow fluorescence and surface plasmon resonance
- Affinity values are reported as Kd (dissociation constant)
