Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll help you extract the data from the scientific literature text. Based on the requirements, I'll create a TSV output with the specified columns.

After carefully reviewing the text, I found one relevant data point:

```tsv
Peptide Ligand Name	Receptor Protein Name	Receptor Protein Organism Source	Affinity Value	Wet Lab Method for Affinity Measurement	Corresponding Complex PDBID
ICAM-1	LFA-1 (Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1)	Homo sapiens	Kd=1.5 ?M	surface plasmon resonance	1MQ8
```

Key observations:
- The text describes the interaction between ICAM-1 (ligand) and LFA-1 (receptor protein)
- The organism source is Homo sapiens
- The affinity value is reported as Kd=1.5 ?M in the text
- The wet lab method used was surface plasmon resonance
- The corresponding complex PDBID is 1MQ8

Note that this extraction follows the strict guidelines:
1. Direct extraction from the text
2. No inference or tampering with data
3. Follows the exact 6-column TSV format
4. Uses the specified formats for affinity value and method

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the extraction?
