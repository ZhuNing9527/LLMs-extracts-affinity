Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I'll create a TSV output with the requested columns.

Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
TIMP-1	Matrix Metalloproteinase-9	Homo sapiens	Kd=35 nM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
TIMP-1	Matrix Metalloproteinase-9	Homo sapiens	Kd=23.9 nM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
TIMP-1	Matrix Metalloproteinase-2	Homo sapiens	Kd=28.6 nM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
TIMP-2	Matrix Metalloproteinase-2	Homo sapiens	Kd=5.2 nM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
TIMP-2	Matrix Metalloproteinase-2	Homo sapiens	Kd=23.1 nM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
TIMP-2	Matrix Metalloproteinase-9	Homo sapiens	Kd=57.9 nM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A

Notes:
- I extracted the Kd values for both high and low affinity sites from the text
- The organism source is Homo sapiens for all entries
- The wet lab method is surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
- No complex PDBID was provided in the text, so I used N/A
- The ligand names are the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2)
- The receptor proteins are Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 and Matrix Metalloproteinase-2
