Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there is only one protein-protein interaction measurement:

```tsv
RalGDS-RBD	Ras	Homo sapiens	Kd=1.9 ?M	stopped-flow fluorescence	1BKD
```

Notes:
- Ligand name: RalGDS-RBD (Ral guanine dissociation stimulator Ras-binding domain)
- Receptor protein name: Ras
- Receptor protein organism source: Homo sapiens (from the context of the paper)
- Affinity value: Kd=1.9 ?M (from the text's discussion of wild-type complex)
- Wet lab method: stopped-flow fluorescence
- Corresponding complex PDBID: 1BKD (from the Protein Data Bank reference in the text)

The paper describes multiple mutants of this interaction, but provides a single comprehensive affinity measurement for the wild-type complex. The other measurements are relative changes in binding kinetics rather than absolute affinity values.
