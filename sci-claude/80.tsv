Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, I notice that this particular paper is about the structural analysis of the Pex5p receptor and its interaction with sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2), rather than a typical ligand-receptor binding affinity study.

I'll extract the available information:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
SCP2	Pex5p	Homo sapiens	Kd=109 nM	isothermal titration calorimetry	Not provided
SCP2 (with stearoyl-CoA)	Pex5p	Homo sapiens	Kd=124 nM	isothermal titration calorimetry	Not provided
preSCP2	Pex5p	Homo sapiens	Kd=74 nM	isothermal titration calorimetry	Not provided
```

Notes:
- The affinity values are derived from Table 1 in the paper
- The wet lab method is isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
- No PDB ID is explicitly mentioned for the complex
- The organism source is Homo sapiens (human)
- The ligand is sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) in different states
