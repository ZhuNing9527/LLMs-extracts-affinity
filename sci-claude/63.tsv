Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. From the text, I can identify the following data points:

```tsv
Im2	E9 DNase	Escherichia coli	Kd=19 nM	NMR	None
Im9	E9 DNase	Escherichia coli	Kd=0.1 fM	NMR	None
```

Notes:
- The text provides details about two immunity proteins (Im2 and Im9) and their interactions with the E9 DNase
- The organism source is Escherichia coli for both proteins
- Affinity values are extracted directly from the text
- The wet lab method appears to be NMR-based characterization
- No PDB complex ID was mentioned in the text, so I've used "None"

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
1. Ligand name: Immunity proteins (Im2, Im9)
2. Receptor protein name: E9 DNase
3. Receptor protein organism source: Escherichia coli
4. Affinity value: Kd values as specified
5. Wet lab method: NMR
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: None
