Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there are no direct measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity that match the exact requirements. The paper is primarily about the biochemical characterization of the Ran-RanBP1-RanGAP system and its role in nuclear transport and mitosis.

The closest relevant data points I can extract are:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Ran-GTP	RanGAP	Schizosaccharomyces pombe	Kd=2 ?M	fluorescence spectroscopy	N/A
Ran-GppNHp	RanGAP	Schizosaccharomyces pombe	Kd=1.7 ?M	fluorescence spectroscopy	N/A
Ran-GDP	RanBP1	N/A	Kd=10 ?M	fluorescence spectroscopy	N/A
Ran-GppNHp	RanBP1	N/A	Kd=1 nM	fluorescence spectroscopy	N/A
```

Note that these are not traditional ligand-receptor binding measurements, but rather interaction measurements between proteins involved in the Ran GTPase system. The paper focuses on kinetic and biochemical characterizations rather than direct affinity measurements of a ligand binding to a receptor.
