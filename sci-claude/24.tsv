Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I apologize, but based on the provided text, I cannot extract the requested data points. The text appears to be a scientific description about polyketide synthases (PKS) and does not contain specific information about:
- Ligand names
- Receptor protein names
- Receptor protein organism sources
- Affinity values
- Wet lab methods for affinity measurement
- Complex PDB IDs

The text seems to be discussing a scientific concept related to polyketide synthases (CalE8/SgcE), but it lacks the specific details required to populate the TSV format you've requested.

If you have additional text or context that contains the specific data points, I'd be happy to help you extract them precisely and accurately. The current text does not provide sufficient information to complete the extraction task.
