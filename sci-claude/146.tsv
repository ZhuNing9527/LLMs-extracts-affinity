Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, after carefully reviewing the text, I did not find a complete set of measurements that match all 6 required columns. The text is a structural biology paper about actin-binding proteins, primarily discussing the structural mechanism of twinfilin's interaction with actin, but not providing specific binding affinity measurements.

Here's an empty TSV output to reflect the lack of extractable data:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
```

If you would like me to extract data, I would need additional scientific literature text that contains specific binding affinity measurements with all the required columns. This particular text is a structural characterization paper that does not provide the specific binding measurements you're seeking.
