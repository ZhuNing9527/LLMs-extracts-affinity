Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I apologize, but the provided text snippet appears to be incomplete and does not contain sufficient information to extract the requested data fields. The text seems to be a partial reference or citation from a scientific publication, but lacks the detailed content needed to identify ligand names, receptor proteins, affinity values, or experimental methods.

To successfully extract the requested data, I would need:
1. The full converted text of the scientific literature
2. A more complete text that describes the specific molecular interactions, experimental methods, and measurements

Without more context, I cannot generate a meaningful TSV output. Could you please provide the complete converted text from the scientific literature?

If you have the full text available, I'd be happy to help you extract the specific data points according to the specified requirements.
