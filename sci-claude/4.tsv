Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there is only one set of measurements related to protein interactions:

```tsv
Transferrin	Transferrin Receptor	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.92 nM	surface plasmon resonance	1DE4
```

Key observations:
1. The text describes interactions between Transferrin (Tf) and Transferrin Receptor (TfR)
2. The organism source is Homo sapiens
3. The affinity was measured using surface plasmon resonance
4. The corresponding complex PDBID is 1DE4
5. The first Kd value is 0.92 nM (for the first binding event)

Note that the text provides detailed scientific analysis of protein interactions, but only presents one clear affinity measurement that matches the requested extraction format.
