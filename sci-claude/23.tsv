Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
BDNF	TrkB	Homo sapiens	Kd=790 pM	surface plasmon resonance	1B8M
NT-4	TrkB	Homo sapiens	Kd=260 pM	surface plasmon resonance	1HCF
NT-3	TrkB	Homo sapiens	Kd=18 nM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
```

Key observations:
- The data is extracted directly from the text without inference
- The affinity values are reported from surface plasmon resonance experiments
- The organism source is Homo sapiens for the TrkB receptor
- PDB IDs are included where available from the text
- The wet lab method is consistently surface plasmon resonance
- NGF did not show binding, so it was not included in the output

The extraction follows the specified 6-column format, with each line representing a distinct affinity measurement from the scientific literature.
