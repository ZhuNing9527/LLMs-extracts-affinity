Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there is only one clear interaction to extract:

```tsv
Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)	Ran	Homo sapiens	Kd=100 nM	isothermal titration calorimetry	Not provided
```

Key observations:
- The text describes interactions between Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2) and RanGDP
- The organism source is Homo sapiens (based on HeLa cells used in experiments)
- The affinity is reported as Kd = 100 nM (using multiple methods including isothermal titration calorimetry)
- No specific PDB ID was provided for the complex

The extraction follows the specified 6-column TSV format:
1. Ligand name
2. Receptor protein name
3. Receptor protein organism source
4. Affinity value
5. Wet lab method for affinity measurement
6. Corresponding complex PDBID
