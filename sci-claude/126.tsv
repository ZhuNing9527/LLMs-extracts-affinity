Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll help you extract the data from the scientific literature text. However, after carefully reviewing the text, I did not find any specific measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity that match the required output format. The text is a detailed structural biology paper about the TolB-Pal protein complex and colicin entry mechanisms, but it does not provide direct affinity measurements in the requested format.

If you would like me to extract any available protein interaction details, I can provide those. But for the specific TSV output with affinity values, there are no suitable data points in this text.

Would you like me to:
1. Explain the key protein interactions described in the text
2. Confirm that no affinity measurements match the required format
3. Something else?
