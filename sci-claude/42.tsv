Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following data points:

```tsv
ML-IAP	Caspase 9	Homo sapiens	Ki=3-5 ?M	enzyme activity assay	NA
ML-IAP	Caspase 3	Homo sapiens	Ki¡Ö100 nM	enzyme activity assay	NA
```

Explanation:
1. The text describes experiments on ML-IAP (melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis) and its interactions with caspases 9 and 3.
2. The organism source is Homo sapiens, as the research was conducted using human cell lines (HEK-293T, MCF7).
3. The affinity values are reported as inhibition constants (Ki):
   - For Caspase 9: Ki = 3-5 ?M
   - For Caspase 3: Ki ¡Ö 100 nM
4. The method used was enzyme activity assay, specifically measuring caspase inhibition.
5. No corresponding PDB complex ID was provided in the text, so I've used "NA".

The data is presented in TSV format with the 6 specified columns: Ligand name, Receptor protein name, Receptor protein organism source, Affinity value, Wet lab method, and Corresponding complex PDBID.
