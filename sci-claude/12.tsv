Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Lysozyme	Anti-lysozyme antibody F10.6.6	Mus musculus	Ka=1.02 °¡ 10^10 M^-1	Biosensor analysis	1P2C
Lysozyme	Anti-lysozyme antibody D44.1	Mus musculus	Ka=1.44 °¡ 10^7 M^-1	Biosensor analysis	Not specified

Notes:
- The data is extracted directly from the text, specifically from Table 1 and the surrounding discussion
- The affinity values are association constants (Ka) measured at 25°„C
- The wet lab method is biosensor analysis (IAsys Plus apparatus)
- The organism source is Mus musculus (mouse) for both antibodies
- The complex PDBID is 1P2C for F10.6.6, while D44.1 does not have a specified PDBID in the text
