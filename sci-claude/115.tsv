Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. In this case, there's only one set of measurements related to protein interactions:

```
HPr	HprK/P	Bacillus subtilis	Kd=45 nM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
Crh	HprK/P	Bacillus subtilis	Kd=39 nM	surface plasmon resonance	N/A
```

Notes:
- The ligands are HPr and Crh
- The receptor protein is HprK/P
- The organism source is Bacillus subtilis for both
- Affinity values are reported as dissociation constants (Kd)
- The wet lab method is surface plasmon resonance
- No corresponding PDB complex ID was provided, so I used N/A

The data follows the specified requirements:
1. Ligand name
2. Receptor protein name
3. Receptor protein organism source
4. Affinity value
5. Wet lab method for affinity measurement
6. Corresponding complex PDBID
