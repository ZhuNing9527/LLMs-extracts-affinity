Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I apologize, but I cannot find any data in the provided text that matches the extraction requirements for ligand-receptor interactions. The text appears to be a scientific publication about affinity maturation in shark antibodies (IgNAR), specifically studying antibody mutations in response to hen egg lysozyme (HEL). 

The text does not contain a clear, extractable dataset of ligand-receptor interactions with the specified columns:
1. Ligand name
2. Receptor protein name
3. Receptor protein organism source
4. Affinity value
5. Wet lab method for affinity measurement
6. Corresponding complex PDBID

If you would like me to extract data from this text, I would need more specific guidance about what information you're seeking. The text is primarily a detailed scientific analysis of antibody mutation mechanisms in sharks.

Would you like me to:
1. Explain the scientific content of the paper?
2. Help you identify a different text for data extraction?
3. Clarify the extraction requirements?
