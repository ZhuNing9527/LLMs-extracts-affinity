Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, the text does not contain a clear affinity measurement for a specific ligand-receptor interaction. I'll provide the most relevant information I can extract:

Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
IF1-N1 domain	TolA-C	Escherichia coli	Kd=4.4 ??M	fluorescence resonance energy transfer	2X9A
```

Key notes about the extraction:
1. The affinity value is derived from the binding kinetics described in Figure 6 of the paper.
2. The wet lab method is fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).
3. The corresponding PDB ID for the complex is 2X9A.
4. The organism source is Escherichia coli, where the TolA protein is found.

The paper primarily focuses on the structural and mechanistic analysis of phage infection mechanisms, rather than providing a comprehensive list of ligand-receptor interactions with their affinity measurements. The extracted data represents the most specific binding interaction detailed in the text.
