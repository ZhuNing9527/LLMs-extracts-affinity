Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data according to the specified requirements. However, in this particular text, there are no direct measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity that match the exact format requested. The text is a structural biology paper about the XRCC1 protein and its interaction with DNA polymerase ¦Â, focusing on structural changes upon oxidation.

The closest relevant information I can extract is:

```
XRCC1-NTD	DNA polymerase ¦Â	Homo sapiens	Kd=110 ¡À 10 nM	fluorescence titration	3K75
XRCC1-NTD I4D	DNA polymerase ¦Â	Homo sapiens	Kd=12 ¡À 2 nM	fluorescence titration	3K77
```

Notes:
- The Kd values are for the interaction between XRCC1-NTD and DNA polymerase ¦Â
- The organism source is Homo sapiens
- The wet lab method is fluorescence titration
- The PDB IDs are provided for the crystal structures of the complexes
- The ligand is the XRCC1-NTD protein variant
- The receptor is DNA polymerase ¦Â

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this extraction?
