Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following data points:

```tsv
Im9	E9 DNase domain	Escherichia coli	Kd=9.3x10^-14 M	stopped-flow fluorescence	None reported
Im2	E9 DNase domain	Escherichia coli	Kd=1.2x10^-7 M	stopped-flow fluorescence	None reported
Im8	E9 DNase domain	Escherichia coli	Kd=0.2-0.7x10^-6 M	stopped-flow fluorescence	None reported
Im7	E9 DNase domain	Escherichia coli	Kd=2.4x10^-6 M	plasmid nicking assay	None reported
```

Notes:
- The data is extracted directly from the literature text
- The organism source is Escherichia coli for all entries
- Affinity values are reported as dissociation constants (Kd)
- Wet lab methods include stopped-flow fluorescence and plasmid nicking assay
- No corresponding complex PDB IDs were reported in the text
- The ligands are immunity proteins (Im2, Im7, Im8, Im9)
- The receptor protein is the E9 DNase domain of colicin E9
