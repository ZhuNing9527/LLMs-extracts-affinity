Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I cannot extract any ligand-receptor binding affinity data in the requested format. This paper is a detailed biochemical and structural characterization of the thioredoxin system from Deinococcus radiodurans, focusing on the thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and thioredoxin (Trx) proteins. The text describes protein purification, kinetic studies, and structural analysis, but does not report specific ligand-receptor binding affinities that match the requested output format.

The paper primarily discusses:
- Cloning and characterization of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase from D. radiodurans
- Kinetic studies of enzyme interactions
- Structural analysis of the proteins
- Comparison with E. coli thioredoxin system

Therefore, I cannot generate a TSV output with the requested columns for ligand-receptor binding data.
