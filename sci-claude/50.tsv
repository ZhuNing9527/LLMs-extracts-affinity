Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following data for extraction:

```tsv
SARS-CoV spike protein	Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)	Homo sapiens	Kd not explicitly stated	Surface plasmon resonance	Not provided
```

Notes on the extraction:
1. The text is a detailed scientific paper about SARS-CoV spike protein interactions with ACE2, but does not provide a direct Kd value in the standard format.
2. While surface plasmon resonance is mentioned as a method, a precise affinity measurement is not explicitly stated in the text.
3. No PDB ID is provided for the complex.

The extraction is limited because the text is a research methodology paper describing the interactions, rather than a direct affinity measurement report. To get more precise data, I would recommend:
- Looking for the supplementary data mentioned in the text
- Checking the referenced publications
- Consulting additional sources that might provide more specific binding affinity measurements

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the extraction or explain the limitations?
