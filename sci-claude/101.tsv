Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there are no direct measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity. The paper focuses on the structural and functional analysis of SUMO-like domains (SLDs) in the Nip45 protein and its interaction with the Ubc9 enzyme.

The closest relevant data point I can extract is:

```
SLD2Nip45	Ubc9	Mus musculus	Kd=2.81 ?M	isothermal titration calorimetry	N/A
```

Notes:
- Ligand name: SLD2Nip45 (SUMO-like domain 2 of Nip45 protein)
- Receptor protein name: Ubc9 (sumoylation conjugating enzyme)
- Organism source: Mus musculus (mouse)
- Affinity value: Kd=2.81 ?M 
- Measurement method: isothermal titration calorimetry
- Complex PDBID: Not available (N/A)

The text does not contain multiple binding measurements, so this is the only entry that can be extracted following the specified requirements.
