Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, here's the TSV output:

```
Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI)	Subtilisin BPN'	Streptomyces albogriseolus	Ki=7.12x10-11 M	fluorescence titration with single photon counting	N/A
```

Explanation of extraction:
1. Ligand name: Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI)
2. Receptor protein name: Subtilisin BPN'
3. Receptor protein organism source: Streptomyces albogriseolus
4. Affinity value: Ki=7.12x10-11 M (from the text: "we obtained values of Kt of (7.12 ?¡À O.39)xlO-nM")
5. Wet lab method: fluorescence titration with single photon counting
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: Not available (N/A) in the text

Note: The extraction follows the guidelines of directly using the data from the literature without inference or tampering.
