Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the ligand-receptor interaction data in the requested TSV format. From the text, I can identify the following interactions:

Notes:
- The organism source is not explicitly specified in the text
- No PDB IDs were provided
- The wet lab method is consistently described as "enzyme activity assay"
- Ki values were extracted directly from the text
- Ligands are the stefin variants (A, B, D1, D2)
- Receptors are various cysteine proteinases
