Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text provided, I'll extract the data according to the specified requirements. However, I notice that this text is primarily about the structural analysis of a tissue factor (TF) and an antibody (5G9), and does not contain a direct affinity measurement that fits the exact format requested.

Here's the closest match I can provide in TSV format:

```
Fab 5G9	Tissue Factor	Homo sapiens	Kd not specified	X-ray crystallography	1TF5
```

Notes:
- The text describes a structural study of an antibody (Fab 5G9) binding to Tissue Factor
- The organism source is human (Homo sapiens)
- No specific binding affinity (Kd) is mentioned in the text
- The method used was X-ray crystallography
- The corresponding PDB ID appears to be 1TF5 (based on the context of the paper)

I want to emphasize that this extraction does not fully meet the original requirements, as the text is more focused on structural characterization rather than providing a precise affinity measurement. A more comprehensive extraction would require additional experimental details not present in this text.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the extraction or explain the limitations of the data source?
