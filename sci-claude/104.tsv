Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following data for extraction:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
TNYL-RAW	EphB4	Homo sapiens	Kd=70 nM	isothermal titration calorimetry	Not specified
```

Explanation of the extraction:
1. Ligand name: TNYL-RAW peptide (TNYLFSPNGPIARAW)
2. Receptor protein name: EphB4
3. Receptor protein organism source: Homo sapiens (human)
4. Affinity value: Kd=70 nM (from the isothermal titration calorimetry results)
5. Wet lab method: isothermal titration calorimetry
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: Not explicitly specified in the text

The data is extracted directly from the literature without inference or tampering, following the specified output requirements.
