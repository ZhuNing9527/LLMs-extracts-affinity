Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
TGFb1	TGFb type II receptor (TbRII)	Homo sapiens	Kd=200 nM	surface plasmon resonance	Not specified
TGFb3	TGFb type II receptor (TbRII)	Homo sapiens	Kd=290 nM	surface plasmon resonance	Not specified
TGFb2	TGFb type II receptor (TbRII)	Homo sapiens	Kd=5 nM	surface plasmon resonance	Not specified
TGFb2-TM (K25R I92V K94R variant)	TGFb type II receptor (TbRII)	Homo sapiens	Kd=480 nM	surface plasmon resonance	Not specified

Note: 
- The affinity values are derived from the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements reported in the paper.
- The organism source is Homo sapiens for all entries.
- No specific PDB complex ID was mentioned in the text.
- TGFb2-TM is a variant of TGFb2 with three residue changes to improve its binding affinity.
