Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following data for extraction:

Ligand name: Amicyanin
Receptor protein name: Methylamine dehydrogenase
Receptor protein organism source: Paracoccus denitrificans
Affinity value: Kd=4.5 ?M (at low ionic strength)
Wet lab method for affinity measurement: Ultrafiltration binding assay with HPLC quantitation
Corresponding complex PDBID: Not specified in the text

Here's the output in TSV format:

```
Amicyanin	Methylamine dehydrogenase	Paracoccus denitrificans	Kd=4.5 ?M	Ultrafiltration binding assay with HPLC quantitation	N/A
```

Note: 
- The affinity value changes to Kd=35 ?M in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl
- No PDB ID was provided in the text for this protein complex
- The data is extracted directly from the literature without inference or tampering
