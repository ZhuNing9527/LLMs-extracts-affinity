Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
PEA-15	ERK1	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.18 ?M	fluorescence anisotropy	N/A
PEA-15	ERK2	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.13 ?M	fluorescence anisotropy	N/A
```

Key observations:
- The ligand is PEA-15, a small anti-apoptotic protein
- The receptor proteins are ERK1 and ERK2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases)
- Organism source is Homo sapiens
- Affinity was measured using fluorescence anisotropy
- The dissociation constants (Kd) are in the range of 0.13-0.18 ?M
- No specific PDB complex ID was mentioned in the text

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
1. Directly extracted from the literature
2. TSV format
3. 6 columns as requested
4. No inferred or tampered data
