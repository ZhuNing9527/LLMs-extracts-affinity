Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there is only one clear set of data that matches the extraction requirements:

```
Tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor (TCI)	Carboxypeptidase B (TAFIa)	Rhipicephalus bursa	Ki=1.2 nM	Not explicitly stated	Not provided
```

Notes:
- The wet lab method for affinity measurement is not explicitly stated in the text
- No corresponding complex PDBID is provided
- The affinity value is derived from the Ki values reported in Table I for human TAFIa
- The organism source is the tick species Rhipicephalus bursa, which produced the inhibitor

The text provides detailed biochemical characterization of the tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor (TCI), but does not comprehensively list all the extraction requirements in the format requested. A more complete dataset would require additional experimental details not present in this text.
