Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, I notice that this particular text is a detailed biochemical study about trypsinogen and does not contain multiple distinct ligand-receptor binding measurements. I'll extract the most relevant information available:

```
Ile-Val	Trypsinogen	Bos taurus	Kd=Not explicitly stated	Circular dichroism spectroscopy	Not provided
```

Key observations:
- The text describes a detailed study of Ile-Val peptide binding to bovine (Bos taurus) trypsinogen
- While binding affinity is discussed, a precise Kd value is not explicitly stated
- The primary measurement technique appears to be circular dichroism spectroscopy
- No PDB ID is mentioned for the complex

The text provides extensive discussion about the binding mechanism, structural changes, and thermodynamics of Ile-Val interaction with trypsinogen, but does not provide a straightforward affinity measurement in the exact format requested.

Would you like me to elaborate on the binding characteristics described in the text, or do you prefer strictly the TSV output as generated?
