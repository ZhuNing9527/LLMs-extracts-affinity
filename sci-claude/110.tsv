Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following data:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Neurexin-1b	Neuroligin-1	Homo sapiens	Kd=97 nM	isothermal titration calorimetry	Not specified in text
Neurexin-1b	Neuroligin-2	Homo sapiens	Kd=830 nM	isothermal titration calorimetry	Not specified in text
```

Notes:
- The text provides two binding measurements between Neurexin-1b and different Neuroligin variants
- The organism source is inferred from the context of the paper (Stanford University researchers studying human proteins)
- The affinity values are directly quoted from the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements
- No specific PDB ID for the complex was mentioned in the text
- The wet lab method is explicitly stated as isothermal titration calorimetry

The data is presented in TSV format with exactly 6 columns as requested, following the specified extraction guidelines.
