Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text provided, I'll extract the data according to the specified requirements. However, in this particular text, there are no direct measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity that fully match the requested format. The paper discusses protein-protein interactions between chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) and subtilisin BPN9, but does not provide a clear affinity measurement in the requested format.

The closest relevant information I can extract is:

```tsv
Chymotrypsin Inhibitor 2 (CI2)	Subtilisin BPN9	Not specified	Ki=2.9?¡ª10^-12 M	Enzyme inhibition assay	Not provided
```

Key observations:
- The text describes a protein engineering study of protein-protein interactions
- The dissociation constant (Ki) for wild-type CI2 binding to subtilisin BPN9 is reported as approximately 10^-12 M
- The organism source is not explicitly stated
- No PDB ID is provided in the text

I recommend consulting additional sources or the original research paper for more complete affinity measurement details. The current text is more focused on the methodology of analyzing protein interactions through mutagenesis rather than providing comprehensive binding affinity data.
