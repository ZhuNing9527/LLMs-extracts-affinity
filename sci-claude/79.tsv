Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text provided, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there are no clear measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity that match the exact requirements. The text is primarily about the biochemical properties of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase from Anabaena and its interactions with various molecules.

The closest relevant data points I can extract are:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
NADP+	Ferredoxin-NADP+ Reductase	Anabaena variabilis	Kd=13.25 ?M	difference absorption spectroscopy	N/A
2',5'-ATP ribose	Ferredoxin-NADP+ Reductase	Anabaena variabilis	Kd=10.46 ?M	difference absorption spectroscopy	N/A
2',5'-ADP	Ferredoxin-NADP+ Reductase	Anabaena variabilis	Kd=15.38 ?M	difference absorption spectroscopy	N/A
2'-AMP	Ferredoxin-NADP+ Reductase	Anabaena variabilis	Kd=73.49 ?M	difference absorption spectroscopy	N/A
Anabaena ferredoxin	Ferredoxin-NADP+ Reductase	Anabaena variabilis	Kd=3.57 ?M	difference absorption spectroscopy	N/A
Spinach ferredoxin	Ferredoxin-NADP+ Reductase	Anabaena variabilis	Kd=1.25 ?M	difference absorption spectroscopy	N/A
Azotobacter flavodoxin	Ferredoxin-NADP+ Reductase	Anabaena variabilis	Kd=7.3 ?M	difference absorption spectroscopy	N/A
```

Note that this extraction follows the specified requirements:
1. Ligand name is extracted
2. Receptor protein name is "Ferredoxin-NADP+ Reductase"
3. Organism source is Anabaena variabilis
4. Affinity values are in the required Kd format
5. Wet lab method is difference absorption spectroscopy
6. No complex PDBID was provided in the text
