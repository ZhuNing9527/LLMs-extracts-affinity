Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I apologize, but after carefully reviewing the provided text, I cannot extract the specific data points requested in the TSV format. The given text appears to be a scientific description about SNARE complex and neurotransmitter release, but it does not contain explicit information about:

1. Ligand names
2. Receptor protein names
3. Receptor protein organism sources
4. Affinity values
5. Wet lab methods for affinity measurement
6. Complex PDB IDs

The text discusses molecular interactions and mechanisms of neurotransmitter release, mentioning proteins like synaptotagmin, complexin, VAMP2, and syntaxin, but does not provide the specific quantitative data required for the TSV output.

To successfully complete this task, I would need:
- A more complete scientific literature text
- Specific sections describing protein-protein or ligand-protein interactions
- Experimental results with measured affinity values

Would you like to provide additional text or clarify the extraction requirements?
