Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text provided, I'll extract the data according to the specified requirements. Here's the TSV output:

```
Antibody ICSM 18 Fab fragment	Prion protein (PrP)	Homo sapiens	Kd=0.1 nM	ELISA	2w9d
```

Explanation of the extraction:
1. Ligand name: "Antibody ICSM 18 Fab fragment"
2. Receptor protein name: "Prion protein (PrP)"
3. Receptor protein organism source: "Homo sapiens"
4. Affinity value: "Kd=0.1 nM" (from the text: "ICSM 18 was our most potent antibody... with affinity for PrPC (Kd 0.1 nM)")
5. Wet lab method: "ELISA" (based on the methods section describing affinity determination)
6. Corresponding complex PDBID: "2w9d" (from the text: "Data deposition: The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (accession nos. 2w9d and 2w9e).")

The extraction follows the specified requirements, using only the information directly present in the text without inference or tampering.
