Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there are no direct measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity that fully match all the required columns. I'll extract the most relevant information available:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
rabenosyn-5(440-503)	Rab4	Homo sapiens	Kd not precisely specified	surface plasmon resonance	1Z0K
rabenosyn-5(728-784)	Rab5	Homo sapiens	Kd not precisely specified	surface plasmon resonance	Not specified
rabenosyn-5(728-784)	Rab22	Homo sapiens	Kd not precisely specified	surface plasmon resonance	1Z0J
```

Notes:
- The text provides detailed structural analysis of Rab GTPase interactions with rabenosyn-5 domains
- Exact Kd values are not consistently reported
- Surface plasmon resonance was the primary method for measuring interactions
- Some PDB IDs are available for the protein complexes

The extraction follows the specified requirements:
1. Ligand name: rabenosyn-5 domain
2. Receptor protein name: Rab GTPases
3. Organism source: Homo sapiens
4. Affinity value: Not precisely specified
5. Method: Surface plasmon resonance
6. Complex PDBID: Where available
