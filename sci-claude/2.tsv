Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I can identify the following extraction:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
BLIP	TEM-1 ¦Â-lactamase	Streptomyces clavuligerus	Kd=0.6 nM	surface plasmon resonance	Not specified
BLIP	TEM-1 ¦Â-lactamase	Streptomyces clavuligerus	Kd=0.4 nM	enzyme inhibition assay	Not specified
BLIP	TEM-1 ¦Â-lactamase	Streptomyces clavuligerus	Kd=0.3 nM	fluorescence quench titration	Not specified
```

Notes:
- The ligand is BLIP (¦Â-lactamase inhibitor protein)
- The receptor protein is TEM-1 ¦Â-lactamase
- The organism source is Streptomyces clavuligerus
- Multiple affinity measurements are reported using different methods
- No specific PDB ID is mentioned in the text
- The affinity values are very close, ranging from 0.3-0.6 nM
- Wet lab methods include surface plasmon resonance, enzyme inhibition assay, and fluorescence quench titration
