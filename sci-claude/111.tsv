Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
I'll extract the data from the scientific literature text according to the specified requirements. Based on the text, I found no direct measurements of ligand-receptor binding affinity that match the exact format requested. The paper is primarily about characterizing hepatitis B virus core and e-antigens and their interactions with monoclonal antibodies.

However, I'll provide a TSV output with the available information from the text:

```
Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
HBeAg	HBc/eAg dimer	Hepatitis B virus	Kd=3.3¡Á10?9 M (for Cp149d)	surface plasmon resonance	Not specified
HBeAg	HBc/eAg dimer	Hepatitis B virus	Kd=1.2¡Á10?7 M (for Cp(?10)149d)	surface plasmon resonance	Not specified
```

Notes:
- The values are derived from surface plasmon resonance measurements of antibody (e6) binding to hepatitis B virus core/e-antigen dimers
- No specific PDB ID was mentioned for these complexes
- The organism source is the virus itself, not a host organism
- These are antibody-antigen interactions, not traditional ligand-receptor binding measurements

Would you like me to clarify anything about this extraction?
