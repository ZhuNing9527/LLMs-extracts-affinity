Ligand name	Receptor protein name	Receptor protein organism source	Affinity value	Wet lab method for affinity measurement	Corresponding complex PDBID
Based on the scientific literature text, I'll extract the data in the requested TSV format. However, in this specific text, there is only one set of measurements that fits the extraction criteria:

```
Yeast iso-1-cytochrome c	Cytochrome c peroxidase	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Kd not explicitly stated	isothermal titration calorimetry	Not provided
```

Note that while the text provides extensive details about the protein interaction, it does not explicitly state a precise Kd (dissociation constant) value. The text describes multiple protein variants and their binding interactions, but does not provide a single, clear affinity measurement in the requested format.

The key details are:
- Ligand: Yeast iso-1-cytochrome c
- Receptor: Cytochrome c peroxidase
- Organism source: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
- Affinity: Not explicitly quantified
- Method: Isothermal titration calorimetry
- Complex PDBID: Not provided

Would you like me to elaborate on the details of the protein interaction described in the text?
